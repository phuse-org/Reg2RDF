dating periods for licensed biological products. 
(a) general. the minimum dating periods in paragraph (c) of this section are based on data relating to usage, clinical experience, or laboratory tests that establish the reasonable period beyond which the product cannot be expected to yield its specific results and retain its safety, purity, and potency, provided the product is maintained at the recommended temperatures. the standards prescribed by the regulations in this subchapter are designed to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the products and are based on the dating periods set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. package labels for each product shall recommend storage at the stated temperatures. 
(b) when the dating period begins. the dating period for a product shall begin on the date of manufacture, as prescribed in  610.50. the dating period for a combination of two or more products shall be no longer than the dating period of the component with the shortest dating period. 
(c) table of dating periods. in using the table in this paragraph, a product in column a may be stored by the manufacturer at the prescribed temperature and length of time in either column b or c, plus the length of time in column d. the dating period in column d shall be applied from the day the product leaves the manufacturer's storage, provided the product has not exceeded its maximum storage period, as prescribed in column b or c. if a product is held in the manufacturer's storage beyond the period prescribed, the dating period for the product being distributed shall be reduced by a corresponding period.
