(1) the adhesive is prepared from one or more of the optional substances named in paragraph (c) of this section, subject to any prescribed limitations. 
(2) the adhesive is either separated from the food by a functional barrier or used subject to the following additional limitations: 
(i) in dry foods. the quantity of adhesive that contacts packaged dry food shall not exceed the limits of good manufacturing practice. 
(ii) in fatty and aqueous foods. ) the quantity of adhesive that contacts packaged fatty and aqueous foods shall not exceed the trace amount at seams and at the edge exposure between packaging laminates that may occur within the limits of good manufacturing practice. 
) under normal conditions of use the packaging seams or laminates will remain firmly bonded without visible separation. 
(b) to assure safe usage of adhesives, the label of the finished adhesive container shall bear the statement food-packaging adhesive. 
(c) subject to any limitation prescribed in this section and in any other regulation promulgated under section 409 of the act which prescribes safe conditions of use for substances that may be employed as constituents of adhesives, the optional substances used in the formulation of adhesives may include the following:
