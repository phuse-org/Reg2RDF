notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of pasteurized blended cheese, pasteurized process cheese, cheese food, cheese spread, and related foods. 
(a) definitions and standards of identity have recently been promulgated under the authority of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act for a number of foods made in part from cheese, including pasteurized process cheese; pasteurized process cheese with fruits, vegetables, or meats; pasteurized blended cheese; pasteurized process cheese food; pasteurized process cheese spread, and related foods. these standards prescribe the name for each such food. the act requires that this name appear on the label. many of these names consist of several words. in the past it has been the practice of some manufacturers to subordinate the words pasteurized, blended, process, food, and spread to give undue prominence to the word cheese and to words naming the variety of cheese involved. 
(b) when placing the names of these foods on labels so as to comply with the requirements of section 403 (a), (f), and (g) of the act, all the words forming the name specified by a definition and standard of identity should be given equal prominence. this can readily be accomplished by printing the specified name of the food in letters of the same size, color, and style of type, and with the same background. 
(c) where the names of optional ingredients are required to appear on the label, the designations of all such ingredients should be given equal prominence. the names of the optional ingredients should appear prominently and conspicuously but should not be displayed with greater prominence than the name of the food. the word contains may precede the names of the optional ingredients, and when so used will not be considered as intervening printed matter between name of food and name of optional ingredients required to be placed on the label. 
(d) where a manufacturer elects to include a label statement of fat and moisture content, the declaration should be on the basis of the food as marketed. a fat declaration on a moisture-free basis is likely to be misleading, and should not be used in labeling.",
