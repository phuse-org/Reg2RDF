refusal to grant orphan-drug designation. 
(a) fda will refuse to grant a request for orphan-drug designation if any of the following reasons apply: 
(1) the drug is not intended for a rare disease or condition because: 
(i) there is insufficient evidence to support the estimate that the drug is intended for treatment of a disease or condition in fewer than 200,000 people in the united states, or that the drug is intended for use in prevention or in diagnosis in fewer than 200,000 people annually in the united states; or 
(ii) where the drug is intended for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition affecting 200,000 or more people in the united states, the sponsor has failed to demonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that development and production costs will be recovered from sales of the drug for such disease or condition in the united states. a sponsor's failure to comply with  316.21 shall constitute a failure to make the demonstration required in this paragraph. 
(2) there is insufficient information about the drug, or the disease or condition for which it is intended, to establish a medically plausible basis for expecting the drug to be effective in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of that disease or condition. 
(3) the drug is otherwise the same drug as an already approved drug for the same rare disease or condition and the sponsor has not submitted a medically plausible hypothesis for the possible clinical superiority of the subsequent drug. 
(b) fda may refuse to grant a request for orphan-drug designation if the request for designation contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits material information or if the request is otherwise ineligible under this part.
