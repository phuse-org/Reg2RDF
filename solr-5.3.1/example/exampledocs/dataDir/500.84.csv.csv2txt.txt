conditions for approval of the sponsored compound. 
(a) on the basis of the results of the chronic bioassays and other information, fda will determine whether any of the substances tested are carcinogenic. 
(b) if fda concludes that the results of the bioassays do not establish carcinogenicity, then fda will not subject the sponsored compound to the remainder of the requirements of this subpart. 
(c) for each sponsored compound that fda decides should be regulated as a carcinogen, fda will either analyze the data from the bioassays using a statistical extrapolation procedure as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or evaluate an alternate procedure proposed by the sponsor as provided in  500.90. in either case, paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section apply. 
(1) for each substance tested in separate bioassays, fda will calculate the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1 million. fda will designate the lowest value obtained as s . because the total diet is not derived from food-producing animals, fda will make corrections for food intake. fda will designate as s the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in test animals of 1 in 1 million. 
(2) from the appropriate residue chemistry data fda will calculate the r as described in  500.86(c). the sponsor must provide a regulatory method in accordance with  500.88(b). fda will calculate the lod of the method from data submitted by the sponsor under  500.88. the lod must be less than or equal to r 
(3) fda will conclude that the provisions of this subpart are satisfied when no residue of the compound is detectable (that is, the marker residue is below the lod) using the approved regulatory method under the conditions of use of the sponsored compound, including any required preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time.
