(a) criteria. the criteria in  312.305(a) must be met; and the following determinations must be made: 
(1) the physician must determine that the probable risk to the person from the investigational drug is not greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition; and 
(2) fda must determine that the patient cannot obtain the drug under another ind or protocol. 
(b) submission. the expanded access submission must include information adequate to demonstrate that the criteria in  312.305(a) and paragraph (a) of this section have been met. the expanded access submission must meet the requirements of  312.305(b). 
(1) if the drug is the subject of an existing ind, the expanded access submission may be made by the sponsor or by a licensed physician. 
(2) a sponsor may satisfy the submission requirements by amending its existing ind to include a protocol for individual patient expanded access. 
(3) a licensed physician may satisfy the submission requirements by obtaining from the sponsor permission for fda to refer to any information in the ind that would be needed to support the expanded access request (right of reference) and by providing any other required information not contained in the ind (usually only the information specific to the individual patient). 
(c) safeguards. (1) treatment is generally limited to a single course of therapy for a specified duration unless fda expressly authorizes multiple courses or chronic therapy. 
(2) at the conclusion of treatment, the licensed physician or sponsor must provide fda with a written summary of the results of the expanded access use, including adverse effects. 
(3) fda may require sponsors to monitor an individual patient expanded access use if the use is for an extended duration. 
(4) when a significant number of similar individual patient expanded access requests have been submitted, fda may ask the sponsor to submit an ind or protocol for the use under  312.315 or  312.320. 
(d) emergency procedures. if there is an emergency that requires the patient to be treated before a written submission can be made, fda may authorize the expanded access use to begin without a written submission. the fda reviewing official may authorize the emergency use by telephone. 
(1) emergency expanded access use may be requested by telephone, facsimile, or other means of electronic communications. for investigational biological drug products regulated by the center for biologics evaluation and research, the request should be directed to the office of communication, outreach and development, center for biologics evaluation and research, 301-827-1800 or 1-800-835-4709, e-mail: ocod@fda.hhs.gov. for all other investigational drugs, the request for authorization should be directed to the division of drug information, center for drug evaluation and research, 301-796-3400, e-mail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov. after normal working hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), the request should be directed to the fda emergency call center, 866-300-4374, e-mail: emergency.operations@fda.hhs.gov. 
(2) the licensed physician or sponsor must explain how the expanded access use will meet the requirements of  312.305 and 312.310 and must agree to submit an expanded access submission within 15 working days of fda's authorization of the use.
