adjuvants for pesticide use dilutions. 
the following surfactants and related adjuvants may be safely added to pesticide use dilutions by a grower or applicant prior to application to the growing crop: 
n- alkyl (c -c 18 ) amine acetate, where the alkyl groups (c -c 18 ) are derived from coconut oil, as a surfactant in emulsifier blends at levels not in excess of 5 percent by weight of the emulsifier blends that are added to herbicides for application to corn and sorghum. di -n- alkyl (c -c 18 ) dimethyl ammonium chloride, where the alkyl groups (c -c 18 ) are derived from coconut oil, as surfactants in emulsifier blends at levels not in excess of 5 percent by weight of emulsifier blends that are added to herbicides for application to corn or sorghum. diethanolamide condensate based on a mixture of saturated and unsaturated soybean oil fatty acids (c 16 -c 18 ) as a surfactant in emulsifier blends that are added to the herbicide atrazine for application to corn. diethanolamide condensate based on stripped coconut fatty acids (c 10 18 ) as a surfactant in emulsifier blends that are added to the herbicide atrazine for application to corn. -( p- dodecylphenyl) -omega- hydroxypoly (oxyethylene) produced by the condensation of 1 mole of dodecylphenol (dodecyl group is a proplyene tetramer isomer) with an average of 4-14 or 30-70 moles of ethylene oxide; if a blend of products is used, the average number of moles of ethylene oxide reacted to produce any product that is a component of the blend shall be in the range of 4-14 or 30-70. ethylene dichloride. polyglyceryl phthalate ester of coconut oil fatty acids. -[ p- (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenyl] -omega- hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) produced by the condensation of 1 mole of p- (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenol with an average of 4-14 or 30-70 moles of ethylene oxide; if a blend of products is used, the average number of moles of ethylene oxide reacted to produce any product that is a component of the blend shall be in the range of 4-14 or 30-70. -[ p- (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenyl]- omega- hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) produced by the condensation of 1 mole of p- (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenol with 1 mole of ethylene oxide. sodium acrylate and acrylamide copolymer with a minimum average molecular weight of 10,000,000 in which 30 percent of the polymer is comprised of acrylate units and 70 percent acrylamide units, for use as a drift control agent in herbicide formulations applied to crops at a level not to exceed 0.5 ounces of the additive per acre.",
