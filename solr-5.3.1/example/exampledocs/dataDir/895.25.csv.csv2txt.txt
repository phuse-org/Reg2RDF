(d) if such voluntary action is not taken, the commissioner may take action under other sections of the act to prevent the introduction of the devices into commerce. the commissioner may consider the failure of a manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device to accomplish the required labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising in accordance with this section as a basis for initiating a proceeding to make a device a banned device in accordance with  895.21(d) and when appropriate to establish a special effective date in accordance with  895.30.",
