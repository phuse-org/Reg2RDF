evaluation of effectiveness. 
(a) the effectiveness of a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical is assessed by evaluating its ability to provide useful clinical information related to its proposed indications for use. the method of this evaluation varies depending upon the proposed indication(s) and may use one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) the claim of structure delineation is established by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting the ability to locate anatomical structures and to characterize their anatomy. 
(2) the claim of functional, physiological, or biochemical assessment is established by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting reliable measurement of function(s) or physiological, biochemical, or molecular process(es). 
(3) the claim of disease or pathology detection or assessment is established by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting that the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical has sufficient accuracy in identifying or characterizing the disease or pathology. 
(4) the claim of diagnostic or therapeutic patient management is established by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting that the test is useful in diagnostic or therapeutic patient management. 
(5) for a claim that does not fall within the indication categories identified in  315.4, the applicant or sponsor should consult fda on how to establish the effectiveness of the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for the claim. 
(b) the accuracy and usefulness of the diagnostic information is determined by comparison with a reliable assessment of actual clinical status. a reliable assessment of actual clinical status may be provided by a diagnostic standard or standards of demonstrated accuracy. in the absence of such diagnostic standard(s), the actual clinical status must be established in another manner, e.g., patient followup.",
