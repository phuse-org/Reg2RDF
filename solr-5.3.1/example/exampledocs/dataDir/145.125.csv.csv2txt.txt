) in the case of a single fruit juice, the name of the juice shall be used in lieu of the word fruit; 
) in the case of a combination of two or more fruit juices, the names of the juices in the order of predominance by weight shall either be used in lieu of the word fruit in the name of the packing medium, or be declared on the label as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section; and 
) in the case of a single fruit juice or a combination of two or more fruit juices any of which are made from concentrate(s), the words from concentrate(s) shall follow the word juice(s) in the name of the packing medium and in the name(s) of such juice(s) when declared as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. 
(iii) whenever the names of the fruit juices used do not appear in the name of the packing medium as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)( ) of this section, such names and the words from concentrate, as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)( ) of this section, shall appear in an ingredient statement pursuant to the requirements of  101.3(d) of this chapter. 
(iv) label declaration. each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter. 
(b) quality. (1) the standard of quality for canned cherries is as follows: 
(i) in the case of pitted cherries, not more than 1 pit is present in each 20 ounces of canned cherries, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. 
(ii) in the case of unpitted cherries, the weight of each cherry in the container is not less than 1/10 ounce. 
(iii) in the case of unpitted cherries, the weight of the largest cherry in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest cherry therein. 
(iv) in the case of unpitted cherries, the total weight of pits is not more than 12 percent of the weight of drained cherries, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. 
(v) not more than 15 percent by count of the cherries in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue or other abnormality. a cherry showing skin discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area exceeding that of a circle 9/32 inch in diameter is considered to be blemished. a cherry showing discoloration of any area but extending into the fruit tissue is also considered to be blemished. 
(2)(i) pitted canned cherries shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: take at random such number of containers as to have a total quantity of contents of at least 24 pounds. open the containers and weigh the contents. count the pits and pieces of pit shell in such total quantity. count a piece of pit shell equal to or smaller than one-half pit shell as one-half pit, and a piece of pit shell larger than one-half pit shell as one pit; but when two or more pieces of pit shell are within or attached to a single cherry, count such pieces as one-half pit if their combined size is equivalent to that of one-half pit shell or less, and as one pit if their combined size is equivalent to that of more than one-half pit shell. from the total number of pits so counted and the combined weight of the contents of all the containers, calculate the number of pits present in each 20 ounces of canned cherries. 
(ii) unpitted canned cherries shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section: tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. the diameter of the sieve is 8 inches if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 3 pounds, or 12 inches if such quantity is 3 pounds or more. the bottom of the sieve is no. 8 woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth in the official methods of analysis of the association of official analytical chemists, 13th ed. (1980), table 1, nominal dimensions of standard test sieves (u.s.a. standard series), under the heading definitions of terms and explanatory notes, which is incorporated by reference. copies may be obtained from the aoac international, 481 north frederick ave., suite 500, gaithersburg, md, 20877-2504, or may be examined at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. without shifting the cherries, so incline the sieve as to facilitate drainage. two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained cherries. the weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the weight of drained cherries. pit the cherries and wash the pits free from adhering flesh. drain and weigh the pits by the method prescribed above. divide the weight of pits so found by the weight of drained cherries, and multiply by 100. 
(3) if the quality of canned cherries falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in  130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; but in lieu of such general statement of substandard quality, the label may bear the alternative statement below standard in quality ___, the blank to be filled in with the words specified after the corresponding number of each subparagraph of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which such canned cherries fail to meet, as follows: 
(i) partially pitted; 
(ii) small; 
(iii) mixed sizes; 
(iv) thin-fleshed; 
(v) blemished. 
such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name cherries and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by  145.125(a)(2). 
(c) fill of container. (1) the standard of fill of container for canned cherries is the maximum quantity of the optional cherry ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing such ingredient. 
(2) if canned cherries fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in  130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.
