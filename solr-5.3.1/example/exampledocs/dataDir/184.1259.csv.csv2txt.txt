cocoa butter substitute. 
(a) the common or usual name for the triglyceride 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearin is cocoa butter substitute primarily from palm oil. the common or usual name for the triglyceride 1-3-distearoyl-2-olein is cocoa butter substitute primarily from high-oleic safflower or sunflower oil. 
(1) the ingredient 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearin is manufactured by: 
(i) directed esterification of fully saturated 1,3-diglycerides (derived from palm oil) with the anhydride of food-grade oleic acid in the presence of the catalyst trifluoromethane sulfonic acid ( 173.395 of this chapter), or 
(ii) by interesterification of partially saturated 1,2,3-triglycerides (derived from palm oil) with ethyl stearate in the presence of a suitable lipase enzyme preparation that is either generally recognized as safe (gras) or has food additive approval for such use. 
(2) the ingredient 1-3-distearoyl-2-olein is manufactured by interesterification of partially unsaturated 1,2,3-triglycerides (derived from high-oleic safflower or sunflower oil) with ethyl stearate or stearic acid in the presence of a suitable lipase enzyme preparation that is either gras or has food additive approval for such use. 
(b) the ingredient meets the following specifications: 
(1) over 90 percent triglycerides, not more than 7 percent diglycerides, not more than 1 percent monoglycerides, and not more than 1 percent free fatty acids. 
(2) total glycerides98 percent minimum. 
(3) heavy metals (as lead), not more than 10 milligrams per kilogram, as determined by the heavy metals test of the food chemicals codex, 4th ed.

(5) odor and tastefree from foreign and rancid odor and taste. 
(6) residual catalyst (official methods of analysis of the association of official analytical chemists, 13th ed. (1980), sections 25.049-25.055, which is incorporated by reference), residual fluorine; limit of detection 0.2 part per million f; multiply fluoride result by 2.63 to convert to residual catalyst. copies of the material incorporated by reference may be obtained from the aoac international, 481 north frederick ave., suite 500, gaithersburg, md 20877, or may be examined at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. the ingredient shall be washed three times in batches with 0.5 percent sodium bicarbonate to remove catalyst residuals in accordance with good manufacturing practice.
