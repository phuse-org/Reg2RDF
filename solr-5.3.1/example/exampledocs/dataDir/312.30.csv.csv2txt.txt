protocol amendments. 
once an ind is in effect, a sponsor shall amend it as needed to ensure that the clinical investigations are conducted according to protocols included in the application. this section sets forth the provisions under which new protocols may be submitted and changes in previously submitted protocols may be made. whenever a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation with an exception from informed consent for emergency research as set forth in  50.24 of this chapter, the sponsor shall submit a separate ind for such investigation. 
(a) new protocol. whenever a sponsor intends to conduct a study that is not covered by a protocol already contained in the ind, the sponsor shall submit to fda a protocol amendment containing the protocol for the study. such study may begin provided two conditions are met: (1) the sponsor has submitted the protocol to fda for its review; and (2) the protocol has been approved by the institutional review board (irb) with responsibility for review and approval of the study in accordance with the requirements of part 56. the sponsor may comply with these two conditions in either order. 
(b) changes in a protocol. (1) a sponsor shall submit a protocol amendment describing any change in a phase 1 protocol that significantly affects the safety of subjects or any change in a phase 2 or 3 protocol that significantly affects the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study. examples of changes requiring an amendment under this paragraph include: 
(i) any increase in drug dosage or duration of exposure of individual subjects to the drug beyond that in the current protocol, or any significant increase in the number of subjects under study. 
(ii) any significant change in the design of a protocol (such as the addition or dropping of a control group). 
(iii) the addition of a new test or procedure that is intended to improve monitoring for, or reduce the risk of, a side effect or adverse event; or the dropping of a test intended to monitor safety. 
(2)(i) a protocol change under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be made provided two conditions are met: 
) the sponsor has submitted the change to fda for its review; and 
) the change has been approved by the irb with responsibility for review and approval of the study. the sponsor may comply with these two conditions in either order. 
(ii) notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately provided fda is subsequently notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing irb is notified in accordance with  56.104(c). 
(c) new investigator. a sponsor shall submit a protocol amendment when a new investigator is added to carry out a previously submitted protocol, except that a protocol amendment is not required when a licensed practitioner is added in the case of a treatment protocol under  312.315 or  312.320. once the investigator is added to the study, the investigational drug may be shipped to the investigator and the investigator may begin participating in the study. the sponsor shall notify fda of the new investigator within 30 days of the investigator being added. 
(d) content and format. a protocol amendment is required to be prominently identified as such ( i.e. , protocol amendment: new protocol, protocol amendment: change in protocol, or protocol amendment: new investigator), and to contain the following: 
(1)(i) in the case of a new protocol, a copy of the new protocol and a brief description of the most clinically significant differences between it and previous protocols. 
(ii) in the case of a change in protocol, a brief description of the change and reference (date and number) to the submission that contained the protocol. 
(iii) in the case of a new investigator, the investigator's name, the qualifications to conduct the investigation, reference to the previously submitted protocol, and all additional information about the investigator's study as is required under  312.23(a)(6)(iii)( ). 
(2) reference, if necessary, to specific technical information in the ind or in a concurrently submitted information amendment to the ind that the sponsor relies on to support any clinically significant change in the new or amended protocol. if the reference is made to supporting information already in the ind, the sponsor shall identify by name, reference number, volume, and page number the location of the information. 
(3) if the sponsor desires fda to comment on the submission, a request for such comment and the specific questions fda's response should address. 
(e) when submitted. a sponsor shall submit a protocol amendment for a new protocol or a change in protocol before its implementation. protocol amendments to add a new investigator or to provide additional information about investigators may be grouped and submitted at 30-day intervals. when several submissions of new protocols or protocol changes are anticipated during a short period, the sponsor is encouraged, to the extent feasible, to include these all in a single submission.
