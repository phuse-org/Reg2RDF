(ii) olefin copolymers described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and polyethylene. a preweighed sample is extracted at 50 c for 2 hours and filtered. the filtrate is evaporated and the total residue weighed as a measure of the solvent extractable fraction. alternatively, the sample is reweighed after the extraction period to give a measure of the solvent extractable fraction. the maximum -hexane-extractable fraction may be determined by the methods set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)( ) through (d)(3)(ii)( ) of this section. 
extraction apparatus. two-liter, straight-walled, pyrex (or equivalent) resin kettles, fitted with three-hole ground-glass covers are most convenient for this purpose. the cover is fitted with a thermometer, a gas-tight stirrer driven by an air motor or explosion-proof electric motor, and a reflux condenser. the kettle is fitted with an electric heating mantle of appropriate size and shape, which is controlled by a variable-voltage transformer. 
evaporating apparatus. rapid evaporation of large volumes of solvent requires special precautions to prevent contamination by dust. this is facilitated by a special gas cover consisting of an inverted flat pyrex crystallizing dish of an appropriate size (190 millimeters  100 millimeters) to fit a 1-liter beaker. through the center of the dish are sealed an inlet tube for preheated, oxygen-free nitrogen, and an outlet tube located 1 inch off center. nitrogen is fed from the supply source through a coil of 1/4 -inch stainless steel tubing immersed in the same steam bath used to supply heat for solvent evaporation. all connections are made with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing. 
reagents ( 1) n-hexane. spec-tro-grade n- hexane. 
2) nitrogen. high-purity dry nitrogen containing less than 10 parts per million of oxygen. 
procedure. transfer 2.5 grams (accurately weighed to nearest 0.001 gram) of the polymer to the resin kettle. add 1 liter of solvent and clamp top in position. start water flowing through jacket of the reflux condenser and apply air pressure to the stirring motor to produce vigorous agitation. turn on heating jacket with transformer set at a predetermined voltage to bring the temperature of the contents to 50 c within 20-25 minutes. as the thermometer reading approaches 45 c-47 c, reduce the voltage to the predetermined setting that will just maintain the temperature at 50 c. do not overshoot the prescribed temperature. should this occur discard the test and start afresh. exactly 2 hours after the solvent temperature has reached 50 c, disconnect the heater, remove the resin kettle from the heating jacket, and decant the solvent, while still warm, through a coarse filter paper placed on top of a fritted-glass funnel, collecting the filtrate in a tared, glass-stoppered erlenmeyer flask of 1-liter capacity. determine the weight of the filtrate recovered to the nearest gram. recovery should be at least 90 percent of the original solvent. losses due to evaporation during heating and filtering have been found not to exceed 10 percent. transfer about half of the solvent filtrate to a 1-liter beaker placed on an opening in the steam bath and immediately cover with the special gas cover, the inlet tube of which has been attached with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing to a source of high-purity nitrogen in series with a stainless steel heating coil immersed directly in the body of the steam bath. maintain a positive flow of warm nitrogen gas throughout the evaporation of the solvent, adding the remainder of the filtrate from the erlenmeyer flask as the evaporation proceeds. when the volume of the solvent has been reduced to about 50 milliliters, transfer the concentrated liquid to a previously tared weighing dish of suitable size. wash the beaker twice with 20-30 milliliter portions of warm solvent, adding the washings to the weighing dish while continuing to evaporate the remainder of the solvent under the gas cover with its flow of warm nitrogen directed toward the center of the dish. in the event that an insoluble residue that cannot be removed with warm solvent remains in the beaker, it may be necessary to heat with a small amount of a higher boiling solvent such as benzene or toluene, transferring these washings to the weighing dish before final evaporation to dryness. transfer the weighing dish with its residue to a vacuum desiccator, and allow it to remain overnight (at least 12 hours), after which the net weight of the dry residue is determined to the nearest 0.0001 gram. correct the result for any solvent blank equivalent to the nonvolatile matter determined to be contained in the amount of solvents used in the test.

procedure. assemble the extraction vessel, condenser, and magnetic stir bar. add -hexane (1 liter) to the extraction vessel and clamp the assembly into a water bath set at 49.5 c 0.5 c. start the water flowing through the jacket of the reflux condenser. adjust the air flow through the stirring motor to give a smooth and uniform stir rate. allow the -hexane to preheat for 1 hour to bring the temperature to 49.5 c0.5 c. temperature is a critical factor in this analysis and it must not vary more than 1 c. if the temperature exceeds these limits, the test must be discontinued and restarted. blown, compression molded, or extrusion cast films can be tested. ideally, the film should be prepared by the same process as will be used with the production resin. using gloves and metal tweezers to avoid sample contamination, cut about 2.7 grams of the prepared film (4 mils or less in thickness) into about 1-inch squares using clean sharp scissors. proceed with option 1 or 2. 
option 1. using tweezers and noting the number of film pieces, transfer 2.5 grams (accurately weighed to 0.1 milligram) of polymer to the extraction vessel. extract the film sample for 2 hours. allow the vessel to cool and filter the contents through a fritted porcelain funnel. wash the film pieces with fresh -hexane, aspirate to dryness, and transfer, using tweezers, to a beaker. recount the film pieces to verify that none were lost during the transfer. place the beaker in the vacuum oven for 2 hours at 80 c 5 c. after 2 hours, remove and place in a desiccator to cool to room temperature (about 1 hour). after cooling, reweigh the film pieces to the nearest 0.1 milligram. calculate the percent hexane-extractables content from the weight loss of the original sample. multiply the result by 0.935 and compare with extraction limits in paragraph (c) of this section. repeat the above procedure for successive samples. 
option 2. transfer 2.50.05 grams of the prepared 1-inch film sections into a tared sample basket and accurately weigh to the nearest 0.1 milligram. carefully raise the condenser until the hook on the positioning rod is above the neck of the 2-liter extraction vessel. the basket should be totally below the level of -hexane solvent. extract the sample resin film for 2 hours and then raise the basket above the solvent level to drain momentarily. remove the basket and rinse the contents by immersing several times in fresh -hexane. allow the basket to dry between rinsings. remove the excess solvent by briefly blowing the basket with a stream of nitrogen or dry air. place the basket in the vacuum oven for 2 hours at 80 c 5 c. after 2 hours, remove and place in a desiccator to cool to room temperature (about 1 hour). after cooling, reweigh the basket to the nearest 0.1 milligram. calculate the percent hexane extractables content from the weight loss of the original sample. multiply the result by 0.935 and compare with extraction limits in paragraph (c) of this section. repeat the above procedure for successive samples. the same solvent charge should remain clear and can be used for at least 12 determinations. applications of solvent reuse should be confirmed for each resin type before use.

procedure. weigh 1 to 2 grams of sample to the nearest 0.001 gram and place in a 125-milliliter pyrex reagent bottle containing a 1-inch long tetrafluoroethylene-resin-coated stirring bar. add 100 milliliters of solvent, set the stopper in lightly, and place the bottle in the heating mantle or aluminum block maintained at a temperature of 120 c, and stir with a magnetic stirrer until the sample is completely dissolved. remove the bottle from the heat and allow it to cool 1 hour in the air, without stirring. then place the bottle in a water bath maintained at 25 c 0.5 c, and allow to stand 1 hour without stirring. next, remove the bottle from the water bath, shake, and pour part of the contents into the coarse-porosity fritted-glass funnel. apply suction, and draw 30-40 milliliters of filtrate through, adding more slurry to the funnel, and catching the filtrate in a large test tube. (if the slurry is hard to filter, add 10 grams of diatomaceous earth filter aid to the bottle and shake vigorously just prior to the filtration.) pipet a suitable aliquot (preferably 20 milliliters) of the filtrate into a tared aluminum disposable dish. place the dish on a steam bath covered with a fresh sheet of aluminum foil and invert a short-stemmed 4-inch funnel over the dish. pass nitrogen (heated if desired) down through the funnel at a rate sufficient to just ripple the surface of the solvent. when the liquid has evaporated, place the dish in a vacuum oven at 140 c and less than 50 millimeters mercury pressure for 2 hours. cool in a desiccator and weigh.
