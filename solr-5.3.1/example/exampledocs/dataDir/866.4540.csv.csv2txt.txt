immunonephelometer equipment. 
(a) identification. immunonephelometer equipment for clinical use with its electrical power supply is a device that measures light scattering from antigen-antibody complexes. the concentration of these complexes may be measured by means of reflected light. a beam of light passed through a solution is scattered by the particles in suspension. the amount of light is detected by a photodetector, which converts light energy into electrical energy. the amount of electrical energy registers on a readout system such as a digital voltmeter or a recording chart. this electrical readout is called the light-scattering value and is used to measure the concentration of antigen-antibody complexes. this generic type of device includes devices with various kinds of light sources, such as laser equipment. 
(b) classification. class i (general controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in  866.9.
