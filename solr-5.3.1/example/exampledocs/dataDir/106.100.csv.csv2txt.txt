(vi) all actions taken to followup on the complaint; and 
(vii) all findings and evaluations of the complaint. 
(6) the manufacturer should maintain the files regarding infant formula complaints at the establishment where the infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed. when the manufacturer wishes to maintain all consumer complaints for the entire firm at one location other than at the facility where an infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed, the manufacturer may do so as long as all records required by this section are available within 24 hours of request for inspection at that facility. however, all records of consumer complaints, including summaries, any reports, and any files, maintained at the manufacturing facility or at any other facility shall be made available to investigators for review and copying upon request. 
(l) the manufacturer shall make readily available for authorized inspection all records required under this part or copies of such records. records shall be available at any reasonable time at the establishment where the activities described in such records occurred. (infant formula complaint files may be maintained at one facility, as provided in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, if all required records are readily available at that facility.) these records or copies thereof shall be subject to photocopying or other means of reproduction as part of such inspection. records that can be immediately retrieved from another location by electronic means shall be considered as meeting the requirements of this paragraph. 
(m) a manufacturer shall maintain all records required under this part in a manner that ensures that both the manufacturer and the food and drug administration can be provided with access to such records within 24 hours. the manufacturer may maintain the records required under this part as original records, as true copies such as photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records, or as electronic records. where reduction techniques, such as microfilming, are used, suitable reader and photocopying equipment shall be readily available. all electronic records maintained under this part shall comply with part 11 of this chapter. 
(n) production control, product testing, testing results, complaints, and distribution records necessary to verify compliance with parts 106, 107, 109, 110, and 113 of this chapter, or with other appropriate regulations, shall be retained for 1 year after the expiration of the shelf life of the infant formula or 3 years from the date of manufacture, whichever is greater. 
(o) the manufacturer shall maintain quality control records that contain sufficient information to permit a public health evaluation of any production aggregate of infant formula. 
(p) a manufacturer shall make and retain records that demonstrate that the formula meets the quality factor of normal physical growth. 
(1) for an infant formula that is not an eligible infant formula, in accordance with  106.96(d), these records shall include: 
(i) records demonstrating compliance with the requirements in  106.96(b), including records made in compliance with  106.121; or
