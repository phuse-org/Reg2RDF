colorants for polymers. 
the substances listed in paragraph (e) of this section may be safely used as colorants in the manufacture of articles or components of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, subject to the provisions and definitions set forth in this section: 
(a) the term colorant means a dye, pigment, or other substance that is used to impart color to or to alter the color of a food-contact material, but that does not migrate to food in amounts that will contribute to that food any color apparent to the naked eye. for the purpose of this section, the term colorant includes substances such as optical brighteners and fluorescent whiteners, which may not themselves be colored, but whose use is intended to affect the color of a food-contact material. 
(b) the colorant must be used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, including use levels which are not in excess of those reasonably required to accomplish the intended coloring effect. 
(c) colorants in this section must conform to the description and specifications indicated. if a polymer described in this section is itself the subject of a regulation promulgated under section 409 of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed by that regulation. extraction testing guidelines to conduct studies for additional uses of colorants under this section are available from the food and drug administration free of charge from the food and drug administration, center for food safety and applied nutrition, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, 240-402-1200 
(d) color additives and their lakes listed for direct use in foods, under the provisions of the color additive regulations in parts 73, 74, 81, and 82 of this chapter, may also be used as colorants for food-contact polymers.
