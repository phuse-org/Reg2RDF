4,4-isopropyl-idenedi-phenol-epichloro-hydrin thermo-setting epoxy resins. 
4,4-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlo-rohydrin thermosetting epoxy resins may be safely used as articles or components of articles intended for repeated use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
(a) the basic thermosetting epoxy resin is made by reacting 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol with epi-chloro-hydrin. 
(b) the resin may contain one or more of the following optional substances provided the quantity used does not exceed that reasonably required to accomplish the intended effect: 
allyl glycidyl ether as curing system additive. di- and tri-glycidyl ester mixture resulting from the reaction of epichlorohydrin with mixed dimers and trimers of unsaturated c 18 monobasic fatty acids derived from animal and vegetable fats and oils as modifier at levels not to exceed equal parts by weight of the 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlorohydrin basic resin and limited to use in contact with alcoholic beverages containing not more than 8 percent of alcohol. 1,2-epoxy-3-phenoxypropane as curing system additive. glyoxal do. 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol do. 4,4-methylenedianiline do. m- phenylenediamine do. tetrahydrophthalic anhydride do. 
(c) in accordance with good manufacturing practice, finished articles containing the resins shall be thoroughly cleansed prior to their first use in contact with food. 
(d) the provisions of this section are not applicable to 4,4-isopropylidenedi-phenol-epichlorohydrin resins listed in other sections of parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and 179 of this chapter.
