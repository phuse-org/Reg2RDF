(a) a pharmacist may dispense directly a controlled substance listed in schedule ii that is a prescription drug as determined under section 503 of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (21 u.s.c. 353(b)) only pursuant to a written prescription signed by the practitioner, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. a paper prescription for a schedule ii controlled substance may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to a pharmacy via facsimile equipment, provided that the original manually signed prescription is presented to the pharmacist for review prior to the actual dispensing of the controlled substance, except as noted in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section. the original prescription shall be maintained in accordance with  1304.04(h) of this chapter. 
(b) an individual practitioner may administer or dispense directly a controlled substance listed in schedule ii in the course of his professional practice without a prescription, subject to  1306.07. 
(c) an institutional practitioner may administer or dispense directly (but not prescribe) a controlled substance listed in schedule ii only pursuant to a written prescription signed by the prescribing individual practitioner or to an order for medication made by an individual practitioner that is dispensed for immediate administration to the ultimate user. 
(d) in the case of an emergency situation, as defined by the secretary in  290.10 of this title, a pharmacist may dispense a controlled substance listed in schedule ii upon receiving oral authorization of a prescribing individual practitioner, provided that: 
(1) the quantity prescribed and dispensed is limited to the amount adequate to treat the patient during the emergency period (dispensing beyond the emergency period must be pursuant to a paper or electronic prescription signed by the prescribing individual practitioner); 
(2) the prescription shall be immediately reduced to writing by the pharmacist and shall contain all information required in  1306.05, except for the signature of the prescribing individual practitioner; 
(3) if the prescribing individual practitioner is not known to the pharmacist, he must make a reasonable effort to determine that the oral authorization came from a registered individual practitioner, which may include a callback to the prescribing individual practitioner using his phone number as listed in the telephone directory and/or other good faith efforts to insure his identity; and 
(4) within 7 days after authorizing an emergency oral prescription, the prescribing individual practitioner shall cause a written prescription for the emergency quantity prescribed to be delivered to the dispensing pharmacist. in addition to conforming to the requirements of  1306.05, the prescription shall have written on its face authorization for emergency dispensing, and the date of the oral order. the paper prescription may be delivered to the pharmacist in person or by mail, but if delivered by mail it must be postmarked within the 7-day period. upon receipt, the dispensing pharmacist must attach this paper prescription to the oral emergency prescription that had earlier been reduced to writing. for electronic prescriptions, the pharmacist must annotate the record of the electronic prescription with the original authorization and date of the oral order. the pharmacist must notify the nearest office of the administration if the prescribing individual practitioner fails to deliver a written prescription to him; failure of the pharmacist to do so shall void the authority conferred by this paragraph to dispense without a written prescription of a prescribing individual practitioner.
