magnesium oxide. 
(a) magnesium oxide (mgo, cas reg. no. 1309-48-4) occurs naturally as the colorless, crystalline mineral periclase. it is produced either as a bulky white powder (light) or a relatively dense white powder (heavy) by heating magnesium hydroxide or carbonate. heating these magnesium salts under moderate conditions (400 to 900 c for a few hours) produces light magnesium oxide. heating the salts under more rigorous conditions (1200 c for 12 hours) produces heavy magnesium oxide. light magnesium oxide is converted to heavy magnesium oxide by sustained heating at high temperatures.
