tamper-evident packaging requirements for over-the-counter (otc) human drug products. 
(a) general. the food and drug administration has the authority under the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (the act) to establish a uniform national requirement for tamper-evident packaging of otc drug products that will improve the security of otc drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of otc drug products. an otc drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant package or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both. 
(b) requirements for tamper-evident package. (1) each manufacturer and packer who packages an otc drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. a tamper-evident package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. to reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, or picture). for purposes of this section, the term distinctive by design means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. a tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to provide a visual indication of package integrity. the tamper-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail display. 
(2) in addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any two-piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an acceptable tamper-evident technology. 
(c) labeling. (1) in order to alert consumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an otc drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is required to bear a statement that: 
(i) identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule sealing technologies used to comply with paragraph (b) of this section; 
(ii) is prominently placed on the package; and 
(iii) is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing. 
(2) if the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section uses an identifying characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. for example, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say for your protection, this bottle has an imprinted seal around the neck. 
(d) request for exemptions from packaging and labeling requirements. a manufacturer or packer may request an exemption from the packaging and labeling requirements of this section. a request for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under  10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a request for exemption from the tamper-evident packaging rule. the petition is required to contain the following: 
(1) the name of the drug product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the drug class, and a list of products within that class. 
(2) the reasons that the drug product's compliance with the tamper-evident packaging or labeling requirements of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved. 
(3) a description of alternative steps that are available, or that the petitioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or drug class will be the subject of malicious adulteration. 
(4) other information justifying an exemption. 
(e) otc drug products subject to approved new drug applications. holders of approved new drug applications for otc drug products are required under  314.70 of this chapter to provide the agency with notification of changes in packaging and labeling to comply with the requirements of this section. changes in packaging and labeling required by this regulation may be made before fda approval, as provided under  314.70(c) of this chapter. manufacturing changes by which capsules are to be sealed require prior fda approval under  314.70(b) of this chapter. 
(f) poison prevention packaging act of 1970. this section does not affect any requirements for special packaging as defined under  310.3(l) of this chapter and required under the poison prevention packaging act of 1970.
