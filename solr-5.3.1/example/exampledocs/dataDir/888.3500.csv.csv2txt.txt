knee joint femorotibial metal/composite semi-constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a knee joint femorotibial metal/composite semi-constrained cemented prosthesis is a two-part device intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. the device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that have a femoral component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a tibial component with the articulating surfaces made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with carbon-fibers composite and is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class ii.",
