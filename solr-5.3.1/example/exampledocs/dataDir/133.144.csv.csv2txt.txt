granular and stirred curd cheese. 
(a) description. (1) granular cheese, stirred curd cheese is the food prepared by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. the minimum milkfat content is 50 percent by weight of the solids and the maximum moisture content is 39 percent by weight as determined by the methods described in  133.5. if the dairy ingredients used are not pasteurized, the cheese is cured at a temperature of not less than 35 f for at least 60 days. 
(2) if pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent value of 0.25 gram of granular cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as determined by the method described in  133.5. 
(3) one or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be warmed, treated with hydrogen peroxide/catalase, and is subjected to the action of a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture. one or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. the mass is so cut, stirred, and heated with continued stirring, as to promote and regulate the separation of whey and curd. a part of the whey is drained off. the curd is then alternately stirred and drained to prevent matting and to remove whey from curd. the curd is then salted, stirred, drained, and pressed into forms. one or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure. 
(b) optional ingredients. the following safe and suitable ingredients may be used: 
(1) dairy ingredients. milk, nonfat milk, or cream, as defined in  133.3, used alone or in combination. 
(2) clotting enzymes. rennet and/or other clotting enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin. 
(3) other optional ingredients. (i) coloring. 
(ii) calcium chloride in an amount not more than 0.02 percent (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) by weight of the dairy ingredients, used as a coagulation aid. 
(iii) enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin, used in curing or flavor development. 
(iv) antimycotic agents, the cumulative levels of which shall not exceed current good manufacturing practice, may be added to the surface of the cheese. 
(v) hydrogen peroxide, followed by a sufficient quantity of catalase preparation to eliminate the hydrogen peroxide. the weight of the hydrogen peroxide shall not exceed 0.05 percent of the weight of the dairy ingredients and the weight of the catalase shall not exceed 20 parts per million of the weight of the dairy ingredients treated. 
(c) nomenclature. the name of the food is granular cheese or, alternatively, stirred curd cheese. 
(d) label declaration. each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that: 
(1) enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin may be declared as enzymes; and 
(2) the dairy ingredients may be declared, in descending order of predominance, by the use of the terms milkfat and nonfat milk or nonfat milk and milkfat, as appropriate.
