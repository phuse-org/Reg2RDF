cardiac allograft gene expression profiling test system. 
(a) identification. a cardiac allograft gene expression profiling test system is a device that measures the ribonucleic acid (rna) expression level of multiple genes and combines this information to yield a signature (pattern, classifier, index, score) to aid in the identification of a low probability of acute cellular rejection (acr) in heart transplant recipients with stable allograft function. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special control is fda's guidance document entitled class ii special controls guidance document: cardiac allograft gene expression profiling test systems. see  862.1(d) for the availability of this guidance document.
