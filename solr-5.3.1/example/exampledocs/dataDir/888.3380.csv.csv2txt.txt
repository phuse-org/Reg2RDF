hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis is a two-part device intended to be implanted to replace the head and neck of the femur. this generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a metallic stem made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, with an integrated cylindrical trunnion bearing at the upper end of the stem that fits into a recess in the head of the device. the head of the device is made of polyacetal (polyoxymethylene) and it is covered by a metallic alloy, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum. the trunnion bearing allows the head of the device to rotate on its stem. the prosthesis is intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class iii. 
(c) date pma or notice of completion of a pdp is required. a pma or a notice of completion of a pdp is required to be filed with the food and drug administration on or before december 26, 1996 for any hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976, or that has, on or before december 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976. any other hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis shall have an approved pma or a declared completed pdp in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
