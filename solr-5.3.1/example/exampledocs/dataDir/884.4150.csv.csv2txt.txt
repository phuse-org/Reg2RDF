bipolar endoscopic coagulator-cutter and accessories. 
(a) identification. a bipolar endoscopic coagulator-cutter is a device used to perform female sterilization and other operative procedures under endoscopic observation. it destroys tissue with high temperatures by directing a high frequency electrical current through tissue between two electrical contacts of a probe. this generic type of device may include the following accessories: an electrical generator, probes, and electrical cables. 
(b) classification. class ii. the special controls for this device are: 
(1) fda's: 
(i) use of international standard iso 10993 biological evaluation of medical devicespart i: evaluation and testing,  
(ii) 510(k) sterility review guidance 2/12/90 (k-90), and 
(iii) guidance (guidelines) for evaluation of laproscopic bipolar and thermal coagulators (and accessories), 
(2) international electrotechnical commission's iec 60601-1-am2 (1995-03), amendment 2, medical electrical equipmentpart 1: general requirements for safety, 
(3) american national standards institute/american association for medical instrumentation's hf-18, 1993, electrosurgical devices, 
(4) labeling: 
(i) indication: for female tubal sterilization, and 
(ii) instructions for use: 
(a) destroy at least 2 centimeters of the fallopian tubes, 
(b) use a cut or undampened sinusoidal waveform, 
(c) use a minimum power of 25 watts, and 
(d) for devices with ammeters: continue electrode activation for 5 seconds after the visual endpoint (tissue blanching) is reached or current flow ceases indicating adequate tissue destruction.
