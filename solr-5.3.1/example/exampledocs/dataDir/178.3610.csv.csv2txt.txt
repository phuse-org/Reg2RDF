-methylstyrene-vinyltoluene resins, hydrogenated. 
hydrogenated -methylstyrene-vinyltoluene copolymer resins having a molar ratio of 1 -methylstyrene to 3 vinyltoluene may be safely used as components of polyolefin film intended for use in contact with food, subject to the following provisions: 
(a) hydrogenated -methylstyrene-vinyltoluene copolymer resins have a drop-softening point of 125 to 165 c and a maximum absorptivity of 0.17 liter per gram centimeter at 266 nanometers, as determined by methods titled determination of softening point (drop method) and determination of unsaturation of resin 1977, which are incorporated by reference. copies are available from the center for food safety and applied nutrition (hfs-200), food and drug administration, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, or available for inspection at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. 
(b) the polyolefin film is produced from olefin polymers complying with  177.1520 of this chapter, and the average thickness of the film in the form in which it contacts food does not exceed 0.002 inch.
