analytical specification for petroleum naphtha general instructions all glassware should be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. as a precautionary measure, it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. no grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. great care to avoid contamination of petroleum naphtha samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light. apparatus separatory funnels. 250-milliliter, and 2,000-milliliter capacity, equipped with tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks. erlenmeyer flask. 125-milliliter with 24/40 standard taper neck. evaporation flask. 250-milliliter capacity all-glass flask equipped with 24/40 standard taper stopper having inlet and outlet tubes to permit passage of nitrogen across the surface of the container liquid to be evaporated. condenser. 24/40 joints, fitted with drying tube, length optional. spectrophotometric cells. fused quartz cells, optical path length in the range of 5,000 centimeters 0.005 centimeter;

(minimize exposure of the borohydride to the atmosphere; a measuring dipper may be used.) immediately fit a water-cooled condenser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a drying tube into the flask, mix until the sodium borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature, with intermittent swirling. at the end of this time, disconnect the flask and evaporate the methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until sodium borohydride begins to drop out of solution. remove the flask and let it cool. add 6 milliliters of isooctane to the flask and swirl to wash the crystalline slurry. carefully transfer the isooctane extract to a 250-milliliter separatory funnel. dissolve the crystals in the flask with about 25 milliliters of distilled water and pour this also into the separatory funnel. adjust the water volume in the separatory funnel to about 100 milliliters and shake for 1 minute. after separation of the layers, draw off the aqueous layer into a second 250-milliliter separatory funnel. transfer the hydrocarbon layer in the first funnel to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask. carefully wash the erlenmeyer flask with an additional 6 milliliters of isooctane, swirl, and transfer to the second separatory funnel. shake the funnel for 1 minute. after separation of the layers, draw off the aqueous layer into the first separatory funnel. transfer the isooctane in the second funnel to the volumetric flask. again wash the erlenmeyer flask with an additional 6 milliliters of isooctane, swirl, and transfer to the first separatory funnel. shake the funnel for 1 minute. after separation of the layers, draw off the aqueous layer and discard. transfer the isooctane layer to the volumetric flask and adjust the volume to 25 milliliters of isooctane. mix the contents well, then transfer to the first separatory funnel and wash twice with 50-milliliter portions of distilled water. discard the aqueous layers after each wash. determine the ultraviolet absorbance of the isooctane extract in 5-centimeter path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280-400 m. determine a reagent blank concurrently with the sample, using 25 milliliters of purified isooctane instead of a solvent sample and measuring the ultraviolet absorbance of the blank between 280-400m. the reagent blank absorbance should not exceed 0.04 per centimeter path length between 280-289 m; 0.020 between 290-359 m; and 0.010 between 360-400 m. determination of boiling-point range. use astm method d86-82, standard method for distillation of petroleum products, which is incorporated by reference. copies may be obtained from the american society for testing materials, 100 barr harbor dr., west conshohocken, philadelphia, pa 19428-2959, or may be examined at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. determination of nonvolatile residue. for hydrocarbons boiling below 121 c, determine the nonvolatile residue by astm method d1353-78, standard test method for nonvolatile matter in volatile solvents for use in paint, varnish, lacquer, and related products; for those boiling above 121 c, use astm method d381-80, standard test method for existent gum in fuels by jet evaporation, which methods are incorporated by reference. copies may be obtained from the american society for testing materials, 100 barr harbor dr., west conshohocken, philadelphia, pa 19428-2959, or may be examined at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
