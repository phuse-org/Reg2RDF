disqualification of a clinical investigator. 
(a) if fda has information indicating that an investigator (including a sponsor-investigator) has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the requirements of this part, part 50 or part 56 of this chapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to fda or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the center for drug evaluation and research or the center for biologics evaluation and research will furnish the investigator written notice of the matter complained of and offer the investigator an opportunity to explain the matter in writing, or, at the option of the investigator, in an informal conference. if an explanation is offered and accepted by the applicable center, the center will discontinue the disqualification proceeding. if an explanation is offered but not accepted by the applicable center, the investigator will be given an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is eligible to receive test articles under this part and eligible to conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by fda. 
(b) after evaluating all available information, including any explanation presented by the investigator, if the commissioner determines that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the requirements of this part, part 50 or part 56 of this chapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to fda or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the commissioner will notify the investigator, the sponsor of any investigation in which the investigator has been named as a participant, and the reviewing institutional review boards (irbs) that the investigator is not eligible to receive test articles under this part. the notification to the investigator, sponsor, and irbs will provide a statement of the basis for such determination. the notification also will explain that an investigator determined to be ineligible to receive test articles under this part will be ineligible to conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by fda, including drugs, biologics, devices, new animal drugs, foods, including dietary supplements, that bear a nutrient content claim or a health claim, infant formulas, food and color additives, and tobacco products. 
(c) each application or submission to fda under the provisions of this chapter containing data reported by an investigator who has been determined to be ineligible to receive fda-regulated test articles is subject to examination to determine whether the investigator has submitted unreliable data that are essential to the continuation of an investigation or essential to the approval of a marketing application, or essential to the continued marketing of an fda-regulated product. 
(d) if the commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is reasonably safe to continue the investigation, the commissioner will notify the sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter. if a danger to the public health exists, however, the commissioner shall terminate the ind immediately and notify the sponsor and the reviewing irbs of the termination. in such case, the sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before fda under part 16 on the question of whether the ind should be reinstated. the determination that an investigation may not be considered in support of a research or marketing application or a notification or petition submission does not, however, relieve the sponsor of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit to fda the results of the investigation. 
(e) if the commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the continued approval of the product for which the data were submitted cannot be justified, the commissioner will proceed to withdraw approval of the product in accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant statutes. 
(f) an investigator who has been determined to be ineligible under paragraph (b) of this section may be reinstated as eligible when the commissioner determines that the investigator has presented adequate assurances that the investigator will employ all test articles, and will conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by fda, solely in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.
