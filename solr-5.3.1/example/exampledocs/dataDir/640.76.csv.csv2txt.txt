products stored or shipped at unacceptable temperatures. 
(a) storage temperature. (1) except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, source plasma intended for manufacture into injectable products that is inadvertently exposed (i.e., an unforeseen occurrence in spite of compliance with good manufacturing practice) to a storage temperature warmer than 20 c and colder than +10 c may be issued only if labeled as source plasma salvaged. the label shall be revised before issuance, and appropriate records shall be maintained identifying the units involved, describing their disposition, and explaining fully the conditions that caused the inadvertent temperature exposure. 
(2) source plasma intended for manufacture into injectable products that is exposed inadvertently (i.e., an unforeseen occurrence in spite of compliance with good manufacturing practice) to one episode of storage temperature fluctuation that is warmer than 20 c and colder than 5 c for not more than 72 hours is exempt from the labeling requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the plasma has been and remains frozen solid. appropriate records shall be maintained identifying the units involved, describing their disposition, explaining fully the conditions that caused the inadvertent temperature exposure, and documenting that the episode of temperature elevation did not exceed 72 hours, that the temperature did not rise to warmer than 5 c in storage, and that the plasma remained frozen solid throughout the period of elevated temperature. when requested, copies of the records shall be provided to the plasma derivative manufacturer. 
(b) shipping temperature. if source plasma for manufacture into injectable products is exposed inadvertently (i.e., an unforeseen occurrence in spite of compliance with good manufacturing practice) to a shipping temperature warmer than 5 c and colder than +10 c, the plasma derivative manufacturer shall label it source plasma salvaged. appropriate records shall be maintained identifying the units involved, describing their disposition, and explaining fully the conditions that caused the inadvertent temperature exposure. 
(c) relabeling. if source plasma is required to be relabeled as source plasma salvaged under paragraph (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the person responsible for the relabeling shall cover the original label with either (1) a complete new label containing the appropriate information or (2) a partial label affixed to the original label and containing the appropriate new information, which covers the incorrect information regarding storage temperature.
