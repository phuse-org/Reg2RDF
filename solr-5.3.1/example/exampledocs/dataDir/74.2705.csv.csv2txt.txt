fd&c yellow no. 5. 
(a) identity. the color additive fd&c yellow no. 5 is principally the trisodium salt of 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-(1-4-sulfophenyl)-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-1 -pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (cas reg. no. 1934-21-0). to manufacture the additive, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is diazotized using hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite. the diazo compound is coupled with 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1 -pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid or with the methyl ester, the ethyl ester, or a salt of this carboxylic acid. the resulting dye is purified and isolated as the sodium salt. 
(b) specifications. (1) fd&c yellow no. 5 shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by good manufacturing practice:
