entamoeba histolytica serological reagents. 
(a) identification. entamoeba histolytica serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to entamoeba histolytica in serum. additionally, some of these reagents consist of antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identify entamoeba histolytica directly from clinical specimens. the identification aids in the diagnosis of amebiasis caused by the microscopic protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by this parasite. the parasite may invade the skin, liver, intestines, lungs, and diaphragm, causing disease conditions such as indolent ulcers, an amebic hepatitis, amebic dysentery, and pulmonary lesions. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to  866.9.
