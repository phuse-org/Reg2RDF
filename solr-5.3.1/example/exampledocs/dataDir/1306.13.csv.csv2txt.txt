partial filling of prescriptions. 
(a) the partial filling of a prescription for a controlled substance listed in schedule ii is permissible if the pharmacist is unable to supply the full quantity called for in a written or emergency oral prescription and he makes a notation of the quantity supplied on the face of the written prescription, written record of the emergency oral prescription, or in the electronic prescription record. the remaining portion of the prescription may be filled within 72 hours of the first partial filling; however, if the remaining portion is not or cannot be filled within the 72-hour period, the pharmacist shall notify the prescribing individual practitioner. no further quantity may be supplied beyond 72 hours without a new prescription. 
(b) a prescription for a schedule ii controlled substance written for a patient in a long term care facility (ltcf) or for a patient with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be filled in partial quantities to include individual dosage units. if there is any question whether a patient may be classified as having a terminal illness, the pharmacist must contact the practitioner prior to partially filling the prescription. both the pharmacist and the prescribing practitioner have a corresponding responsibility to assure that the controlled substance is for a terminally ill patient. the pharmacist must record on the prescription whether the patient is terminally ill or an ltcf patient. a prescription that is partially filled and does not contain the notation terminally ill or ltcf patient shall be deemed to have been filled in violation of the act. for each partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist shall record on the back of the prescription (or on another appropriate record, uniformly maintained, and readily retrievable) the date of the partial filling, quantity dispensed, remaining quantity authorized to be dispensed, and the identification of the dispensing pharmacist. the total quantity of schedule ii controlled substances dispensed in all partial fillings must not exceed the total quantity prescribed. schedule ii prescriptions for patients in a ltcf or patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness shall be valid for a period not to exceed 60 days from the issue date unless sooner terminated by the discontinuance of medication. 
(c) information pertaining to current schedule ii prescriptions for patients in a ltcf or for patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be maintained in a computerized system if this system has the capability to permit: 
(1) output (display or printout) of the original prescription number, date of issue, identification of prescribing individual practitioner, identification of patient, address of the ltcf or address of the hospital or residence of the patient, identification of medication authorized (to include dosage, form, strength and quantity), listing of the partial fillings that have been dispensed under each prescription and the information required in  1306.13(b). 
(2) immediate (real time) updating of the prescription record each time a partial filling of the prescription is conducted. 
(3) retrieval of partially filled schedule ii prescription information is the same as required by  1306.22(b) (4) and (5) for schedule iii and iv prescription refill information.
