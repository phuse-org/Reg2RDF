(3) component means any ingredient intended for use in the manufacture of a drug product, including those that may not appear in such drug product. 
(4) drug product means a finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, solution, etc., that contains an active drug ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients. the term also includes a finished dosage form that does not contain an active ingredient but is intended to be used as a placebo. 
(5) fiber means any particulate contaminant with a length at least three times greater than its width. 
(6) nonfiber releasing filter means any filter, which after appropriate pretreatment such as washing or flushing, will not release fibers into the component or drug product that is being filtered. 
(7) active ingredient means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. the term includes those components that may undergo chemical change in the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect. 
(8) inactive ingredient means any component other than an active ingredient. 
(9) in-process material means any material fabricated, compounded, blended, or derived by chemical reaction that is produced for, and used in, the preparation of the drug product. 
(10) lot means a batch, or a specific identified portion of a batch, having uniform character and quality within specified limits; or, in the case of a drug product produced by continuous process, it is a specific identified amount produced in a unit of time or quantity in a manner that assures its having uniform character and quality within specified limits. 
(11) lot number, control number, or batch number means any distinctive combination of letters, numbers, or symbols, or any combination of them, from which the complete history of the manufacture, processing, packing, holding, and distribution of a batch or lot of drug product or other material can be determined. 
(12) manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product includes packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drug products. 
(13) the term medicated feed means any type b or type c medicated feed as defined in  558.3 of this chapter. the feed contains one or more drugs as defined in section 201(g) of the act. the manufacture of medicated feeds is subject to the requirements of part 225 of this chapter.

(ii) the potency, that is, the therapeutic activity of the drug product as indicated by appropriate laboratory tests or by adequately developed and controlled clinical data (expressed, for example, in terms of units by reference to a standard). 
(17) theoretical yield means the quantity that would be produced at any appropriate phase of manufacture, processing, or packing of a particular drug product, based upon the quantity of components to be used, in the absence of any loss or error in actual production. 
(18) actual yield means the quantity that is actually produced at any appropriate phase of manufacture, processing, or packing of a particular drug product. 
(19) percentage of theoretical yield means the ratio of the actual yield (at any appropriate phase of manufacture, processing, or packing of a particular drug product) to the theoretical yield (at the same phase), stated as a percentage. 
(20) acceptance criteria means the product specifications and acceptance/rejection criteria, such as acceptable quality level and unacceptable quality level, with an associated sampling plan, that are necessary for making a decision to accept or reject a lot or batch (or any other convenient subgroups of manufactured units). 
(21) representative sample means a sample that consists of a number of units that are drawn based on rational criteria such as random sampling and intended to assure that the sample accurately portrays the material being sampled. 
(22) gang-printed labeling means labeling derived from a sheet of material on which more than one item of labeling is printed.
