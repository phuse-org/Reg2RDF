general. 
(a) sections 513(e) and (f), 514(b), 515(b), and 520(l) of the act provide for reclassification of a device and prescribe the procedures to be followed to effect reclassification. the purposes of subpart c are to: 
(1) set forth the requirements as to form and content of petitions for reclassification; 
(2) describe the circumstances in which each of the five statutory reclassification provisions applies; and 
(3) explain the procedure for reclassification prescribed in the five statutory reclassification provisions. 
(b) the criteria for determining the proper class for a device are set forth in  860.3(c). the reclassification of any device within a generic type of device causes the reclassification of all substantially equivalent devices within that generic type. accordingly, a petition for the reclassification of a specific device will be considered a petition for reclassification of all substantially equivalent devices within the same generic type. 
(c) any interested person may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(e), 514(b), or 515(b). a manufacturer or importer may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(f) or 520(l). the commissioner may initiate the reclassification of a device classified into class iii under sections 513(f) and 520(l) of the act.
