termination of requirements. 
if fda determines after approval that the requirements established in  601.42,  601.43, or  601.45 are no longer necessary for the safe and effective use of a biological product, it will so notify the applicant. ordinarily, for biological products approved under  601.41, these requirements will no longer apply when fda determines that the required postmarketing study verifies and describes the biological product's clinical benefit and the biological product would be appropriate for approval under traditional procedures. for biological products approved under  601.42, the restrictions would no longer apply when fda determines that safe use of the biological product can be assured through appropriate labeling. fda also retains the discretion to remove specific postapproval requirements upon review of a petition submitted by the sponsor in accordance with  10.30.",
