respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay. 
(a) identification. a respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic device intended to simultaneously detect and identify multiple viral nucleic acids extracted from human respiratory specimens or viral culture. the detection and identification of a specific viral nucleic acid from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection when used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. the device is intended for detection and identification of a combination of the following viruses: 
(1) influenza a and influenza b; 
(2) influenza a subtype h1 and influenza a subtype h3; 
(3) respiratory syncytial virus subtype a and respiratory syncytial virus subtype b; 
(4) parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, and parainfluenza 3 virus; 
(5) human metapneumovirus; 
(6) rhinovirus; and 
(7) adenovirus. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special controls are: 
(1) fda's guidance document entitled class ii special controls guidance document: respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay; 
(2) for a device that detects and identifies human metapneumovirus, fda's guidance document entitled class ii special controls guidance document: testing for human metapneumovirus (hmpv) using nucleic acid assays; and 
(3) for a device that detects and differentiates influenza a subtype h1 and subtype h3, fda's guidance document entitled class ii special controls guidance document: testing for detection and differentiation of influenza a virus subtypes using multiplex nucleic acid assays. see  866.1(e) for the availability of these guidance documents.
