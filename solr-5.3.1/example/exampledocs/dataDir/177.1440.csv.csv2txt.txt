4,4-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlorohydrin resins minimum molecular weight 10,000. 
4,4-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlo-rohydrin resins having a minimum molecular weight of 10,000 may be safely used as articles or components of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
(a) 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol-ep-ichlorohydrin resins consist of basic resins produced by the condensation of equimolar amounts of 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol and epichlorohydrin terminated with phenol, to which may have been added certain optional adjuvant substances required in the production of the resins. 
(b) the optional adjuvant substances required in the production of the resins may include substances generally recognized as safe in food, substances used in accordance with a prior sanction or approval, and the following: 
list of substances limitations butyl alcohol not to exceed 300 p.p.m. as residual solvent in finished resin. ethyl alcohol toluene not to exceed 1,000 p.p.m. as residual solvent in finished resin. 
(c) 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol-ep-ichlorohydrin resins shall meet the following nonvolatile extractives limitations: 
(1) maximum extractable nonvolatile fraction of 2 parts per million when extracted with distilled water at 70 c for 2 hours, using a volume-to-surface ratio of 2 milliliters per square inch. 
(2) maximum extractable nonvolatile fraction of 3 parts per million when extracted with n- heptane at 70 c for 2 hours, using a volume-to-surface ratio of 2 milliliters per square inch. 
(3) maximum extractable nonvolatile fraction of 6 parts per million when extracted with 10 percent (by volume) ethyl alcohol in distilled water at 70 c for 2 hours, using a volume-to-surface ratio of 2 milliliters per square inch. 
(d) the provisions of this section are not applicable to 4,4-isopropylidene-diphenol-epichlorohydrin resins listed in other sections of subchapter b of this chapter.",
