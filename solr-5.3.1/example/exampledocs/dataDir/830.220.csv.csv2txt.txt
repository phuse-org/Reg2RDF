" 830.220 
termination of fda service as an issuing agency. 
(a) fda may end our services as an issuing agency if we determine that the conditions that prompted us to act no longer exist and that ending our services would not be likely to lead to a return of the conditions that prompted us to act. 
(b) if fda has ended our services as an issuing agency, a labeler may continue to use a device identifier assigned under fda's unique device identification system until such time as  830.50 requires the use of a new device identifier.",
