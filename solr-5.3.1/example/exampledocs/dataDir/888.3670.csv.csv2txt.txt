shoulder joint metal/polymer/metal nonconstrained or semi-constrained porous-coated uncemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a shoulder joint metal/polymer/metal nonconstrained or semi-constrained porous-coated uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a shoulder joint. the device limits movement in one or more planes. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that have a humeral component made of alloys such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (co-cr-mo) and titanium-aluminum-vanadium (ti-6al-4v) alloys, and a glenoid resurfacing component made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, or a combination of an articulating ultra-high molecular weight bearing surface fixed in a metal shell made of alloys such as co-cr-mo and ti-6al-4v. the humeral component and glenoid backing have a porous coating made of, in the case of co-cr-mo components, beads of the same alloy or commercially pure titanium powder, and in the case of ti-6al-4v components, beads or fibers of commercially pure titanium or ti-6al-4v alloy, or commercially pure titanium powder. the porous coating has a volume porosity between 30 and 70 percent, an average pore size between 100 and 1,000 microns, interconnecting porosity, and a porous coating thickness between 500 and 1,500 microns. this generic type of device is designed to achieve biological fixation to bone without the use of bone cement. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special control for this device is fda's class ii special controls guidance: shoulder joint metal/polymer/metal nonconstrained or semi-constrained porous-coated uncemented prosthesis.
