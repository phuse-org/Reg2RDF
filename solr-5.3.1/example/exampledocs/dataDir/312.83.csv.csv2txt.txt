if the preliminary analysis of phase 2 test results appears promising, fda may ask the sponsor to submit a treatment protocol to be reviewed under the procedures and criteria listed in  312.305 and 312.320. such a treatment protocol, if requested and granted, would normally remain in effect while the complete data necessary for a marketing application are being assembled by the sponsor and reviewed by fda (unless grounds exist for clinical hold of ongoing protocols, as provided in  312.42(b)(3)(ii)).
