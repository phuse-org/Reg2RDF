(d) extractives limitations. the following extractives limitations are determined by an infrared spectro-photo-metric method titled infrared spectro-photo-metric determination of polymer extracted from borex  210 resin pellets, which is incorporated by reference. copies are available from the center for food safety and applied nutrition (hfs-200), food and drug administration, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, or available for inspection at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. copies are applicable to the modified copolymers in the form of particles of a size that will pass through a u.s. standard sieve no. 6 and that will be held on a u.s. standard sieve no. 10: 
(1) the extracted copolymer shall not exceed 2.0 ppm in aqueous extract obtained when a 100-gram sample of copolymer is extracted with 250 milliliters of freshly distilled water at reflux temperature for 2 hours. 
(2) the extracted copolymer shall not exceed 0.5 ppm in n- heptane when a 100-gram sample of the basic copol-ymer is extracted with 250 milliliters spectral grade n- heptane at reflux temperature for 2 hours. 
(e) accelerated extraction end test. the modified copolymer shall yield acrylonitrile monomer not in excess of 0.4 ppm when tested as follows: 
(1) the modified copolymer shall be in the form of eight strips 1/2 inch by 4 inches by .03 inch. 
(2) the modified copolymer strips shall be immersed in 225 milliliters of 3 percent acetic acid in a pyrex glass pressure bottle. 
(3) the pyrex glass pressure bottle is then sealed and heated to 150 f in either a circulating air oven or a thermostat controlled bath for a period of 8 days. 
(4) the pyrex glass pressure bottle is then removed from the oven or bath and cooled to room temperature. a sample of the extracting solvent is then withdrawn and analyzed for acrylonitrile monomer by a gas chromatographic method titled gas-solid chromatographic procedure for determining acrylonitrile monomer in acrylonitrile-containing polymers and food simulating solvents, which is incorporated by reference. copies, are available from the center for food safety and applied nutrition (hfs-200), food and drug administration, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, or available for inspection at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
