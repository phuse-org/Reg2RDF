refractometer for clinical use. 
(a) identification. a refractometer for clinical use is a device intended to determine the amount of solute in a solution by measuring the index of refraction (the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to the velocity of light in the solution). the index of refraction is used to measure the concentration of certain analytes (solutes), such a plasma total proteins and urinary total solids. measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain conditions. 
(b) classification. class i (general controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in  862.9.
