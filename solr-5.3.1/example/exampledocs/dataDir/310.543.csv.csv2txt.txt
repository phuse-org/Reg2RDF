drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter (otc) for human use in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. 
(a) hemicellulase, pancreatin, and pancrelipase have been present as ingredients in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products. pancreatin and pancrelipase are composed of enzymes: amylase, trypsin (protease), and lipase. significant differences have been shown in the bioavailability of marketed exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products produced by different manufacturers. these differences raise a potential for serious risk to patients using these drug products. the bioavailability of pancreatic enzymes is dependent on the process used to manufacture the drug products. information on this process is not included in an otc drug monograph. therefore, the safe and effective use of these enzymes for treating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency cannot be regulated adequately by an otc drug monograph. information on the product's formulation, manufacture, quality control procedures, and final formulation effectiveness testing are necessary in an approved application to ensure that a company has the ability to manufacture a proper bioactive formulation. in addition, continuous physician monitoring of patients who take these drug products is a collateral measure necessary to the safe and effective use of these enzymes, causing such products to be available by prescription only. 
(b) any drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted for otc use in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (the act), for which an approved application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. in the absence of an approved application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act. 
(c) clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted for otc use in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is safe and effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter. 
(d) after may 7, 1991, any such otc drug product that contains hemicellulase initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action. 
(e) after october 24, 1995, any such otc drug product that contains pancreatin or pancrelipase initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.
