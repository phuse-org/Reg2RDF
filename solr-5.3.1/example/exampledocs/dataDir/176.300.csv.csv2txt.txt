slimicides. 
(a) slimicides may be safely used in the manufacture of paper and paperboard that contact food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
(1) slimicides are used as antimicrobial agents to control slime in the manufacture of paper and paperboard. 
(2) subject to any prescribed limitations, slimicides are prepared from one or more of the slime-control substances named in paragraph (c) of this section to which may be added optional adjuvant substances as provided for under paragraph (d) of this section. 
(3) slimicides are added to the process water used in the production of paper or paperboard, and the quantity added shall not exceed the amount necessary to accomplish the intended technical effect. 
(b) to insure safe usage, the label or labeling of slimicides shall bear adequate directions for use. 
(c) slime-control substances permitted for use in the preparation of slimicides include substances subject to prior sanction or approval for such use and the following:
