(c) optional dairy ingredients. cream, milk, partially skimmed milk, or skim milk, used alone or in combination. 
(d) other optional ingredients. (1) concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk, buttermilk, whey, lactose, lact-al-bum-ins, lacto-globulins, or whey modified by partial or complete removal of lactose and/or minerals, to increase the nonfat solids content of the food: provided, that the ratio of protein to total nonfat solids of the food, and the protein efficiency ratio of all protein present shall not be decreased as a result of adding such ingredients. 
(2) nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners. sugar (sucrose), beet or cane; invert sugar (in paste or sirup form); brown sugar; refiner's sirup; molasses (other than blackstrap); high fructose corn sirup; fructose; fructose sirup; maltose; maltose sirup, dried maltose sirup; malt extract, dried malt extract; malt sirup, dried malt sirup; honey; maple sugar; or any of the sweeteners listed in part 168 of this chapter, except table sirup.

(1) milkfat contentas determined by the method prescribed in section 16.059 roese-gottlieb method (reference method) (11)official final action, under the heading fat. 
(2) milk solids not fat contentcalculated by subtracting the milkfat content from the total solids content as determined by the method prescribed in section 16.032, method iofficial final action, under the heading total solids. 
(3) titratable acidityas determined by the method prescribed in section 16.023, acidity (2)official final action, or by an equivalent potentiometric method. 
(f) nomenclature. the name of the food is yogurt. the name of the food shall be accompanied by a declaration indicating the presence of any characterizing flavoring as specified in  101.22 of this chapter. 
(1) the following terms shall accompany the name of the food wherever it appears on the principal display panel or panels of the label in letters not less than one-half of the height of the letters used in such name: 
(i) the word sweetened if nutritive carbohydrate sweetener is added without the addition of characterizing flavor. 
(ii) the parenthetical phrase (heat-treated after culturing) shall follow the name of the food if the dairy ingredients have been heat-treated after culturing. 
(iii) the phrase vitamin a or vitamin a added, or vitamin d or vitamin d added, or vitamins a and d added, as appropriate. the word vitamin may be abbreviated vit. 
(2) the term homogenized may appear on the label if the dairy ingredients used are homogenized. 
(g) label declaration. each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
