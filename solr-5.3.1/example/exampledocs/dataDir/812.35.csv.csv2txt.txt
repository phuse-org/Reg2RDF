supplemental applications. 
(a) changes in investigational plan (1) changes requiring prior approval. except as described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section, a sponsor must obtain approval of a supplemental application under  812.30(a), and irb approval when appropriate (see  56.110 and 56.111 of this chapter), prior to implementing a change to an investigational plan. if a sponsor intends to conduct an investigation that involves an exception to informed consent under  50.24 of this chapter, the sponsor shall submit a separate investigational device exemption (ide) application in accordance with  812.20(a). 
(2) changes effected for emergency use. the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding fda approval of a supplement do not apply in the case of a deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. such deviation shall be reported to fda within 5-working days after the sponsor learns of it (see  812.150(a)(4)). 
(3) changes effected with notice to fda within 5 days. a sponsor may make certain changes without prior approval of a supplemental application under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the sponsor determines that these changes meet the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section, on the basis of credible information defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, and the sponsor provides notice to fda within 5-working days of making these changes. 
(i) developmental changes. the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding fda approval of a supplement do not apply to developmental changes in the device (including manufacturing changes) that do not constitute a significant change in design or basic principles of operation and that are made in response to information gathered during the course of an investigation. 
(ii) changes to clinical protocol. the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding fda approval of a supplement do not apply to changes to clinical protocols that do not affect: 
(a) the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol; 
(b) the scientific soundness of the investigational plan; or 
(c) the rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation. 
(iii) definition of credible information. (a) credible information to support developmental changes in the device (including manufacturing changes) includes data generated under the design control procedures of  820.30, preclinical/animal testing, peer reviewed published literature, or other reliable information such as clinical information gathered during a trial or marketing. 
(b) credible information to support changes to clinical protocols is defined as the sponsor's documentation supporting the conclusion that a change does not have a significant impact on the study design or planned statistical analysis, and that the change does not affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects. documentation shall include information such as peer reviewed published literature, the recommendation of the clinical investigator(s), and/or the data gathered during the clinical trial or marketing. 
(iv) notice of ide change. changes meeting the criteria in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section that are supported by credible information as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section may be made without prior fda approval if the sponsor submits a notice of the change to the ide not later than 5-working days after making the change. changes to devices are deemed to occur on the date the device, manufactured incorporating the design or manufacturing change, is distributed to the investigator(s). changes to a clinical protocol are deemed to occur when a clinical investigator is notified by the sponsor that the change should be implemented in the protocol or, for sponsor-investigator studies, when a sponsor-investigator incorporates the change in the protocol. such notices shall be identified as a notice of ide change. 
(a) for a developmental or manufacturing change to the device, the notice shall include a summary of the relevant information gathered during the course of the investigation upon which the change was based; a description of the change to the device or manufacturing process (cross-referenced to the appropriate sections of the original device description or manufacturing process); and, if design controls were used to assess the change, a statement that no new risks were identified by appropriate risk analysis and that the verification and validation testing, as appropriate, demonstrated that the design outputs met the design input requirements. if another method of assessment was used, the notice shall include a summary of the information which served as the credible information supporting the change. 
(b) for a protocol change, the notice shall include a description of the change (cross-referenced to the appropriate sections of the original protocol); an assessment supporting the conclusion that the change does not have a significant impact on the study design or planned statistical analysis; and a summary of the information that served as the credible information supporting the sponsor's determination that the change does not affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects. 
(4) changes submitted in annual report. the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply to minor changes to the purpose of the study, risk analysis, monitoring procedures, labeling, informed consent materials, and irb information that do not affect: 
(i) the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol; 
(ii) the scientific soundness of the investigational plan; or 
(iii) the rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation. such changes shall be reported in the annual progress report for the ide, under  812.150(b)(5). 
(b) irb approval for new facilities. a sponsor shall submit to fda a certification of any irb approval of an investigation or a part of an investigation not included in the ide application. if the investigation is otherwise unchanged, the supplemental application shall consist of an updating of the information required by  812.20(b) and (c) and a description of any modifications in the investigational plan required by the irb as a condition of approval. a certification of irb approval need not be included in the initial submission of the supplemental application, and such certification is not a precondition for agency consideration of the application. nevertheless, a sponsor may not begin a part of an investigation at a facility until the irb has approved the investigation, fda has received the certification of irb approval, and fda, under  812.30(a), has approved the supplemental application relating to that part of the investigation (see  56.103(a)).
