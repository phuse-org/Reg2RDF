hip joint metal/polymer constrained cemented or uncemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a hip joint metal/polymer constrained cemented or uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a hip joint. the device prevents dislocation in more than one anatomic plane and has components that are linked together. this generic type of device includes prostheses that have a femoral component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and an acetabular component made of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene with or without a metal shell, made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum and titanium alloys. this generic type of device is intended for use with or without bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special control for this device is the fda guidance document entitled class ii special controls guidance: hip joint metal/polymer constrained cemented or uncemented prosthesis.
