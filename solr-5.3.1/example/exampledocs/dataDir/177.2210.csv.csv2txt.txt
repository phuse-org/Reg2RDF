ethylene polymer, chloro-sulfonated. 
ethylene polymer, chlorosulfonated as identified in this section may be safely used as an article or component of articles intended for use in contact with food, subject to the provisions of this section. 
(a) ethylene polymer, chloro-sulfonated is produced by chloro-sulfonation of a carbon tetrachloride solution of polyethylene with chlorine and sulfuryl chloride. 
(b) ethylene polymer, chloro-sulfonated shall meet the following specifications: 
(1) chlorine not to exceed 25 percent by weight. 
(2) sulfur not to exceed 1.15 percent by weight. 
(3) molecular weight is in the range of 95,000 to 125,000. 
methods for the specifications in this paragraph (b), titled chlorine and brominecoulometric titration method by aminco chloridometer, hypolon  synthetic rubberdetermination of sulfur by parr bomb, and astm method d2857-70 (reapproved 1977), standard test method for dilute solution viscosity of polymers, are incorporated by reference. copies of the astm method may be obtained from the american society for testing materials, 100 barr harbor dr., west conshohocken, philadelphia, pa 19428-2959. copies of the other two methods are available from the center for food safety and applied nutrition (hfs-200), food and drug administration, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740. copies of all three methods may be examined at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. 
(c) the additive is used as the article, or a component of articles, intended for use as liners and covers for reservoirs intended for the storage of water for drinking purposes. 
(d) substances permitted by  177.2600 may be employed in the preparation of ethylene polymers, chlorosulfonated, subject to any limitations prescribed therein. 
(e) the finished ethylene copolymers, chlorosulfonated shall conform to  177.2600(e) and (g).
