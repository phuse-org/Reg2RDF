(2) the end-of-phase 2 and pre-nda meetings described in  312.47(b) will also provide a timely forum for discussing and resolving scientific and medical issues on which the sponsor disagrees with the agency. 
(3) in requesting a meeting designed to resolve a scientific or medical dispute, applicants may suggest that fda seek the advice of outside experts, in which case fda may, in its discretion, invite to the meeting one or more of its advisory committee members or other consultants, as designated by the agency. applicants may rely on, and may bring to any meeting, their own consultants. for major scientific and medical policy issues not resolved by informal meetings, fda may refer the matter to one of its standing advisory committees for its consideration and recommendations.
