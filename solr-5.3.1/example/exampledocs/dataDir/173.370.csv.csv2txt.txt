(b)(1) the additive is used as an antimicrobial agent on meat carcasses, parts, trim, and organs in accordance with current industry practice where the maximum concentration of peroxyacids is 220 parts per million (ppm) as peroxyacetic acid, and the maximum concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 75 ppm.

(c) the concentrations of peroxyacids and hydrogen peroxide in the additive are determined by a method entitled hydrogen peroxide and peracid (as peracetic acid) content, july 26, 2000, developed by ecolab, inc., st. paul, mn, which is incorporated by reference. the concentration of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid is determined by a method entitled determination of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (hedp) peroxyacid/peroxide-containing solutions, august 21, 2001, developed by ecolab, inc., st. paul, mn, which is incorporated by reference. the director of the office of the federal register approves these incorporations by reference in accordance with 5 u.s.c. 552(a) and 1 cfr part 51. you may obtain copies of these methods from the division of petition review, center for food safety and applied nutrition, food and drug administration, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, or you may examine a copy at the center for food safety and applied nutrition's library, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, or at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
