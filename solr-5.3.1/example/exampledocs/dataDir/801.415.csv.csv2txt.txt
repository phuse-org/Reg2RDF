maximum acceptable level of ozone. 
(a) ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. in order for ozone to be effective as a germicide, it must be present in a concentration far greater than that which can be safely tolerated by man and animals. 
(b) although undesirable physiological effects on the central nervous system, heart, and vision have been reported, the predominant physiological effect of ozone is primary irritation of the mucous membranes. inhalation of ozone can cause sufficient irritation to the lungs to result in pulmonary edema. the onset of pulmonary edema is usually delayed for some hours after exposure; thus, symptomatic response is not a reliable warning of exposure to toxic concentrations of ozone. since olfactory fatigue develops readily, the odor of ozone is not a reliable index of atmospheric ozone concentration. 
(c) a number of devices currently on the market generate ozone by design or as a byproduct. since exposure to ozone above a certain concentration can be injurious to health, any such device will be considered adulterated and/or misbranded within the meaning of sections 501 and 502 of the act if it is used or intended for use under the following conditions: 
(1) in such a manner that it generates ozone at a level in excess of 0.05 part per million by volume of air circulating through the device or causes an accumulation of ozone in excess of 0.05 part per million by volume of air (when measured under standard conditions at 25 c (77 f) and 760 millimeters of mercury) in the atmosphere of enclosed space intended to be occupied by people for extended periods of time, e.g., houses, apartments, hospitals, and offices. this applies to any such device, whether portable or permanent or part of any system, which generates ozone by design or as an inadvertent or incidental product. 
(2) to generate ozone and release it into the atmosphere in hospitals or other establishments occupied by the ill or infirm. 
(3) to generate ozone and release it into the atmosphere and does not indicate in its labeling the maximum acceptable concentration of ozone which may be generated (not to exceed 0.05 part per million by volume of air circulating through the device) as established herein and the smallest area in which such device can be used so as not to produce an ozone accumulation in excess of 0.05 part per million. 
(4) in any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness. 
(5) to generate ozone at a level less than 0.05 part per million by volume of air circulating through the device and it is labeled for use as a germicide or deodorizer. 
(d) this section does not affect the present threshold limit value of 0.10 part per million (0.2 milligram per cubic meter) of ozone exposure for an 8-hour-day exposure of industrial workers as recommended by the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists. 
(e) the method and apparatus specified in 40 cfr part 50, or any other equally sensitive and accurate method, may be employed in measuring ozone pursuant to this section.",
