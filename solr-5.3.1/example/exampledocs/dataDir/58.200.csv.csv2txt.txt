(1) to permit the exclusion from consideration of completed studies that were conducted by a testing facility which has failed to comply with the requirements of the good laboratory practice regulations until it can be adequately demonstrated that such noncompliance did not occur during, or did not affect the validity or acceptability of data generated by, a particular study; and 
(2) to exclude from consideration all studies completed after the date of disqualification until the facility can satisfy the commissioner that it will conduct studies in compliance with such regulations. 
(b) the determination that a nonclinical laboratory study may not be considered in support of an application for a research or marketing permit does not, however, relieve the applicant for such a permit of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the results of the study to the food and drug administration.",
