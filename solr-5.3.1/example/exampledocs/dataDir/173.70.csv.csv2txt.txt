chloromethylated aminated styrene-divinylbenzene resin. 
chloromethylated aminated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer (cas reg. no. 60177-39-1) may be safely used in food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
(a) the additive is an aqueous dispersion of styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, first chloromethylated then aminated with trimethylamine, having an average particle size of not more than 2.0 microns. 
(b) the additive shall contain no more than 3.0 percent nonvolatile, soluble extractives when tested as follows: one hundred grams of the additive is centrifuged at 17,000 r/min for 2 hours. the resulting clear supernatant is removed from the compacted solids and concentrated to approximately 10 grams on a steam bath. the 10-gram sample is again centrifuged at 17,000 r/min for 2 hours to remove any residual insoluble material. the supernatant from the second centrifugation is then removed from any compacted solids and dried to constant residual weight using a steam bath. the percent nonvolatile solubles is obtained by dividing the weight of the dried residue by the weight of the solids in the original resin dispersion. 
(c) the additive is used as a decolorizing and clarification agent for treatment of refinery sugar liquors and juices at levels not to exceed 500 parts of additive solids per million parts of sugar solids.
