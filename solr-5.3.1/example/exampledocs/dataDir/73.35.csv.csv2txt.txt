(1) the color additive is used to enhance the pink to orange-red color of the flesh of salmonid fish. 
(2) the quantity of color additive in feed is such that the color additive shall not exceed 80 milligrams per kilogram (72 grams per ton) of finished feed. 
(d) labeling requirements. (1) the labeling of the color additive and any premixes prepared therefrom shall bear expiration dates for the sealed and open container (established through generally accepted stability testing methods), other information required by  70.25 of this chapter, and adequate directions to prepare a final product complying with the limitations prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2) the presence of the color additive in finished fish feed prepared according to paragraph (c) of this section shall be declared in accordance with  501.4 of this chapter. 
(3) the presence of the color additive in salmonid fish that have been fed feeds containing astaxanthin shall be declared in accordance with  101.22(k)(2) and 101.100(a)(2) of this chapter.
