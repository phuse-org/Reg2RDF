(c) manufacturers and distributors should take notice that the information on otc drugs provided by the drug efficacy study review is valuable information as to the deficiencies in the data available to support indications for use. they are encouraged to perform studies to obtain adequate evidence of effectiveness for the review of otc drugs which is already in progress. in the interim it is in the public interest that manufacturers and distributors of all otc drugs effect changes in their formulations and/or labeling to bring the products into conformity with current medical knowledge and experience. 
(d) manufacturers and distributors of otc drugs may be reluctant to make appropriate formulation and/or labeling changes for fear of losing the protection of the so-called grandfather provisions of the 1938 federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (sec. 201(p)(1)) and the 1962 amendments to the act (sec. 107(c) of those amendments). to encourage and facilitate prompt changes, the food and drug administration will not take legal action against any otc drug, other than those not deferred, based on a charge that the product is a new drug and not grandfathered under the act as a result of the changes if the changes in formulation and/or labeling are of the following kind: 
(1) the addition to the labeling of warning, contraindications, side effects, and/or precaution information. 
(2) the deletion from the labeling of false, misleading, or unsupported indications for use or claims of effectiveness. 
(3) changes in the components or composition of the drug that will give increased assurance that the drug will have its intended effect, yet not raise or contribute any added safety questions. 
(4) changes in the components or composition of the drug which may reasonably be concluded to improve the safety of the drug, without diminishing its effectiveness. 
(e) the forbearance from legal action for lack of grandfather protection is an interim procedure designed to encourage appropriate change in formulation and/or labeling during the time period required to review the various classes of otc drugs. at such time as an applicable otc drug monograph becomes effective, the interim procedure will automatically be terminated and any appropriate regulatory action will be initiated.",
