drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter (otc) for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
(a) quinine sulfate alone or in combination with vitamin e has been present in over-the-counter (otc) drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, i.e. , a condition of localized pain in the lower extremities usually occurring in middle life and beyond with no regular pattern concerning time or severity. there is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of quinine sulfate, vitamin e, or any other ingredients for otc use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. in the doses used to treat or prevent this condition, quinine sulfate has caused adverse events such as transient visual and auditory disturbances, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. quinine sulfate may cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions requiring medical intervention and hospitalization; fatalities have been reported. the risk associated with use of quinine sulfate, in the absence of evidence of its effectiveness, outweighs any potential benefit in treating and/or preventing this benign, self-limiting condition. based upon the adverse benefit-to-risk ratio, any drug product containing quinine or quinine sulfate cannot be considered generally recognized as safe for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
(b) any otc drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (the act), for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. in the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act. 
(c) clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted for otc use for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is safe and effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter. 
(d) after february 22, 1995, any such otc drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.
