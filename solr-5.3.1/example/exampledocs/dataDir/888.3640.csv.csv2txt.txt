shoulder joint metal/metal or metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a shoulder joint metal/metal or metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a shoulder joint. the device prevents dislocation in more than one anatomic plane and has components that are linked together. this generic type of device includes prostheses that have a humeral component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a glenoid component made of this alloy or a combination of this alloy and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. this generic type of device is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class iii. 
(c) date pma or notice of completion of a pdp is required. a pma or a notice of completion of a pdp is required to be filed with the food and drug administration on or before december 26, 1996 for any shoulder joint metal/metal or metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976, or that has, on or before december 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a shoulder joint metal/metal or metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976. any other shoulder joint metal/metal or metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis shall have an approved pma or a declared completed pdp in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
