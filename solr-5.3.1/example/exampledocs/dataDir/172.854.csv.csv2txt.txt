polyglycerol esters of fatty acids. 
polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, up to and including the decaglycerol esters, may be safely used in food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
(a) they are prepared from corn oil, cottonseed oil, lard, palm oil from fruit, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and tallow and the fatty acids derived from these substances (hydrogenated and nonhydrogenated) meeting the requirements of  172.860(b) and/or oleic acid derived from tall oil fatty acids meeting the requirements of  172.862. 
(b) they are used as emulsifiers in food, in amounts not greater than that required to produce the intended physical or technical effect. 
(c) polyglycerol esters of a mixture of stearic, oleic, and coconut fatty acids are used as a cloud inhibitor in vegetable and salad oils when use is not precluded by standards of identity. the fatty acids used in the production of the polyglycerol esters meet the requirements of  172.860(b), and the polyglycerol esters are used at a level not in excess of the amount required to perform its cloud-inhibiting effect. oleic acid derived from tall oil fatty acids conforming with  172.862 may be used as a substitute for or together with the oleic acid permitted by this paragraph. 
(d) polyglycerol esters of butter oil fatty acids are used as emulsifiers in combination with other approved emulsifiers in dry, whipped topping base. the fatty acids used in the production of the polyglycerol esters meet the requirements of  172.860(b), and the polyglycerol esters are used at a level not in excess of the amount required to perform their emulsifying effect.",
