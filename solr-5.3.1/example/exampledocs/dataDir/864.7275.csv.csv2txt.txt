euglobulin lysis time tests. 
(a) identification. a euglobulin lysis time test is a device that measures the length of time required for the lysis (dissolution) of a clot formed from fibrinogen in the euglobulin fraction (that fraction of the plasma responsible for the formation of plasmin, a clot lysing enzyme). this test evaluates natural fibrinolysis (destruction of a blood clot after bleeding has been arrested). the test also will detect accelerated fibrinolysis. 
(b) classification. class ii (performance standards).
