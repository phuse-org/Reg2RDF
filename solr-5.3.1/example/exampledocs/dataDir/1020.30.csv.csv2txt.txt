(ii) for each mode of operation, a descriptive example(s) of any specific clinical procedure(s) or imaging task(s) for which the mode is recommended or designed and how each mode should be used. such recommendations do not preclude other clinical uses. 
(6) displays of values of akr and cumulative air kerma. for fluoroscopic x-ray systems manufactured on or after june 10, 2006, the following shall be provided: 
(i) a schedule of maintenance for any system instrumentation associated with the display of air kerma information necessary to maintain the displays of akr and cumulative air kerma within the limits of allowed uncertainty specified by  1020.32(k)(6) and, if the capability for user calibration of the display is provided, adequate instructions for such calibration; 
(ii) identification of the distances along the beam axis:

(iii) a rationale for specification of a reference irradiation location alternative to 15 cm from the isocenter toward the x-ray source along the beam axis when such alternative specification is made according to  1020.32(k)(4)(ii). 
(i) [reserved] 
(j) warning label. the control panel containing the main power switch shall bear the warning statement, legible and accessible to view: 
warning: this x-ray unit may be dangerous to patient and operator unless safe exposure factors, operating instructions and maintenance schedules are observed. 
(k) leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly. the leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly measured at a distance of 1 meter in any direction from the source shall not exceed 0.88 milligray (mgy) air kerma (vice 100 milliroentgen (mr) exposure) in 1 hour when the x-ray tube is operated at the leakage technique factors. if the maximum rated peak tube potential of the tube housing assembly is greater than the maximum rated peak tube potential for the diagnostic source assembly, positive means shall be provided to limit the maximum x-ray tube potential to that of the diagnostic source assembly. compliance shall be determined by measurements averaged over an area of 100 square cm with no linear dimension greater than 20 cm. 
(l) radiation from components other than the diagnostic source assembly. the radiation emitted by a component other than the diagnostic source assembly shall not exceed an air kerma of 18 microgy (vice 2 mr exposure) in 1 hour at 5 cm from any accessible surface of the component when it is operated in an assembled x-ray system under any conditions for which it was designed. compliance shall be determined by measurements averaged over an area of 100 square cm with no linear dimension greater than 20 cm. 
(m) beam quality (1) half-value layer (hvl). the hvl of the useful beam for a given x-ray tube potential shall not be less than the appropriate value shown in table 1 in paragraph (m)(1) of this section under the heading specified dental systems, for any dental x-ray system designed for use with intraoral image receptors and manufactured after december 1, 1980; under the heading iother x-ray systems, for any dental x-ray system designed for use with intraoral image receptors and manufactured before december 1, 1980, and all other x-ray systems subject to this section and manufactured before june 10, 2006; and under the heading iiother x-ray systems, for all x-ray systems, except dental x-ray systems designed for use with intraoral image receptors, subject to this section and manufactured on or after june 10, 2006. if it is necessary to determine such hvl at an x-ray tube potential which is not listed in table 1 in paragraph (m)(1) of this section, linear interpolation or extrapolation may be made. positive means shall be provided to ensure that at least the minimum filtration needed to achieve the above beam quality requirements is in the useful beam during each exposure. table 1 follows: 
in the case of a system, which is to be operated with more than one thickness of filtration, this requirement can be met by a filter interlocked with the kilovoltage selector which will prevent x-ray emissions if the minimum required filtration is not in place.
