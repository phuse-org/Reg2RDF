(b) it is used or intended for use in an amount calculated on a dry weight basis, as follows: 
(1) as a pelleting aid in the liquid or dry form in an amount not to exceed 4 percent of the finished pellets. 
(2) as a binding aid in the liquid form in the flaking of feed grains in an amount not to exceed 4 percent of the flaked grain.
