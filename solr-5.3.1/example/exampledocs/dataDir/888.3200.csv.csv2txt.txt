finger joint metal/metal constrained uncemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a finger joint metal/metal constrained uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal (finger) joint. the device prevents dislocation in more than one anatomic plane and consists of two components which are linked together. this generic type of device includes prostheses made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, or protheses made from alloys and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. this generic type of device is limited to prostheses intended for use without bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class iii. 
(c) date pma or notice of completion of a pdp is required. a pma or a notice of completion of a pdp is required to be filed with the food and drug administration on or before december 26, 1996 for any finger joint metal/metal constrained uncemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976, or that has, on or before december 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a finger joint metal/metal constrained uncemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976. any other finger joint metal/metal constrained uncemented prosthesis shall have an approved pma or a declared completed pdp in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
