complete response letter to the applicant. 
(a) complete response letter. the food and drug administration will send the biologics license applicant or supplement applicant a complete response letter if the agency determines that it will not approve the biologics license application or supplement in its present form. 
(1) description of specific deficiencies. a complete response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the agency has identified in a biologics license application or supplement, except as stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
(2) inadequate data. if fda determines, after a biologics license application or supplement is filed, that the data submitted are inadequate to support approval, the agency might issue a complete response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed product labeling. 
(3) recommendation of actions for approval. when possible, a complete response letter will recommend actions that the applicant might take to place its biologics license application or supplement in condition for approval. 
(b) applicant actions. after receiving a complete response letter, the biologics license applicant or supplement applicant must take either of the following actions: 
(1) resubmission. resubmit the application or supplement, addressing all deficiencies identified in the complete response letter. 
(2) withdrawal. withdraw the application or supplement. a decision to withdraw the application or supplement is without prejudice to a subsequent submission. 
(c) failure to take action. (1) fda may consider a biologics license applicant or supplement applicant's failure to either resubmit or withdraw the application or supplement within 1 year after issuance of a complete response letter to be a request by the applicant to withdraw the application or supplement, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the application or supplement. fda will grant any reasonable request for such an extension. fda may consider an applicant's failure to resubmit the application or supplement within the extended time period or request an additional extension to be a request by the applicant to withdraw the application. 
(2) if fda considers an applicant's failure to take action in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be a request to withdraw the application, the agency will notify the applicant in writing. the applicant will have 30 days from the date of the notification to explain why the application or supplement should not be withdrawn and to request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application or supplement. fda will grant any reasonable request for an extension. if the applicant does not respond to the notification within 30 days, the application or supplement will be deemed to be withdrawn.
