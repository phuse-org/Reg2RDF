" 16.42 
presiding officer. 
(a) an fda employee to whom the commissioner delegates such authority, or any other agency employee designated by an employee to whom such authority is delegated, or, consistent with 5 cfr 930.209(b) or (c), an administrative law judge to whom such authority is delegated, may serve as the presiding officer and conduct a regulatory hearing under this part. 
(b) in a regulatory hearing required by the act or a regulation, the presiding officer is to be free from bias or prejudice and may not have participated in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing or be subordinate to a person, other than the commissioner, who has participated in such investigation or action. 
(c)(1) the commissioner or the delegate under  16.40 is not precluded by this section from prior participation in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing. if there has been prior participation, the commissioner or the delegate should, if feasible, designate a presiding officer for the hearing who is not a subordinate. thus, if the commissioner's authority to make a final decision has been delegated to a center director, the presiding officer may be an official in another center or the office of the commissioner. the exercise of general supervisory responsibility, or the designation of the presiding officer, does not constitute prior participation in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing so as to preclude the commissioner or delegate from designating a subordinate as the presiding officer. 
(2) the party requesting a hearing may make a written request to have the commissioner or the delegate under  16.40 be the presiding officer, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section. if accepted, as a matter of discretion, by the commissioner or the delegate, the request is binding upon the party making the request. 
(3) a different presiding officer may be substituted for the one originally designated under  16.22 without notice to the parties.
