exception from general requirements. 
(a) the obtaining of informed consent shall be deemed feasible unless, before use of the test article (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section), both the investigator and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation certify in writing all of the following: 
(1) the human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the test article. 
(2) informed consent cannot be obtained from the subject because of an inability to communicate with, or obtain legally effective consent from, the subject. 
(3) time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legal representative. 
(4) there is available no alternative method of approved or generally recognized therapy that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the life of the subject. 
(b) if immediate use of the test article is, in the investigator's opinion, required to preserve the life of the subject, and time is not sufficient to obtain the independent determination required in paragraph (a) of this section in advance of using the test article, the determinations of the clinical investigator shall be made and, within 5 working days after the use of the article, be reviewed and evaluated in writing by a physician who is not participating in the clinical investigation.

(e)(1) obtaining informed consent for investigational in vitro diagnostic devices used to identify chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents will be deemed feasible unless, before use of the test article, both the investigator (e.g., clinical laboratory director or other responsible individual) and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation make the determinations and later certify in writing all of the following: 
(i) the human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the investigational in vitro diagnostic device to identify a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent that would suggest a terrorism event or other public health emergency. 
(ii) informed consent cannot be obtained from the subject because: 
(a) there was no reasonable way for the person directing that the specimen be collected to know, at the time the specimen was collected, that there would be a need to use the investigational in vitro diagnostic device on that subject's specimen; and 
(b) time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject without risking the life of the subject. 
(iii) time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legally authorized representative.
