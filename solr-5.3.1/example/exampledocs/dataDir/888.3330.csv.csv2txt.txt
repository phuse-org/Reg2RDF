hip joint metal/metal semi-constrained, with an uncemented acetabular component, prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a hip joint metal/metal semi-constrained, with an uncemented acetabular component, prosthesis is a two-part device intended to be implanted to replace a hip joint. the device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a femoral and an acetabular component, both made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum. the femoral component is intended to be fixed with bone cement. the acetabular component is intended for use without bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class iii. 
(c) date pma or notice of completion of a pdp is required. no effective date has been established of the requirement for premarket approval. see  888.3.",
