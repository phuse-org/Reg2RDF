laboratory records. 
(a) laboratory records shall include complete data derived from all tests necessary to assure compliance with established specifications and standards, including examinations and assays, as follows: 
(1) a description of the sample received for testing with identification of source (that is, location from where sample was obtained), quantity, lot number or other distinctive code, date sample was taken, and date sample was received for testing. 
(2) a statement of each method used in the testing of the sample. the statement shall indicate the location of data that establish that the methods used in the testing of the sample meet proper standards of accuracy and reliability as applied to the product tested. (if the method employed is in the current revision of the united states pharmacopeia, national formulary, aoac international, book of methods, or in other recognized standard references, or is detailed in an approved new drug application and the referenced method is not modified, a statement indicating the method and reference will suffice). the suitability of all testing methods used shall be verified under actual conditions of use. 
copies may be obtained from: aoac international, 481 north frederick ave., suite 500, gaithersburg, md 20877. 
(3) a statement of the weight or measure of sample used for each test, where appropriate. 
(4) a complete record of all data secured in the course of each test, including all graphs, charts, and spectra from laboratory instrumentation, properly identified to show the specific component, drug product container, closure, in-process material, or drug product, and lot tested. 
(5) a record of all calculations performed in connection with the test, including units of measure, conversion factors, and equivalency factors. 
(6) a statement of the results of tests and how the results compare with established standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity for the component, drug product container, closure, in-process material, or drug product tested. 
(7) the initials or signature of the person who performs each test and the date(s) the tests were performed. 
(8) the initials or signature of a second person showing that the original records have been reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with established standards. 
(b) complete records shall be maintained of any modification of an established method employed in testing. such records shall include the reason for the modification and data to verify that the modification produced results that are at least as accurate and reliable for the material being tested as the established method. 
(c) complete records shall be maintained of any testing and standardization of laboratory reference standards, reagents, and standard solutions. 
(d) complete records shall be maintained of the periodic calibration of laboratory instruments, apparatus, gauges, and recording devices required by  211.160(b)(4). 
(e) complete records shall be maintained of all stability testing performed in accordance with  211.166.
