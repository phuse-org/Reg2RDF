(c) special considerations. (1) type c medicated feeds for cattle may be manufactured from tylosin liquid type b medicated feeds which have a ph between 4.5 and 6.0 and which bear appropriate mixing directions as follows: 
(i) for liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: recirculate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, moving not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom of the tank to the top. recirculate daily as described even when not used. 
(ii) for liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-type tank systems: agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible at the top. agitate daily as described even when not used.
