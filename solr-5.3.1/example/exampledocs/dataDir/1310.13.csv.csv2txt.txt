(ii) if a group of mixtures (e.g. formulations having identical function and containing the same listed chemical(s)), the information required in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and a brief narrative of their use. 
(4) (i) the complete qualitative and quantitative composition of the chemical mixture (including all listed and all non-listed chemicals); or 
(ii) if a group of mixtures, the concentration range for the listed chemical and a listing of all non-listed chemicals with respective concentration ranges. 
(5) (i) the chemical and physical properties of the mixture and how they differ from the properties of the listed chemical or chemicals; and 
(ii) if a group of mixtures, how the group's properties differ from the properties of the listed chemical. 
(6) a statement that the applicant believes justifies an exemption for the chemical mixture or group of mixtures. the statement must explain how the chemical mixture(s) meets the exemption criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. 
(7) a statement that the applicant accepts the right of the administrator to terminate exemption from regulation for the chemical mixture(s) granted exemption under this section.

(g) a manufacturer of an exempted chemical mixture shall notify dea in writing, of any change in the quantitative or qualitative composition of a chemical mixture that has been granted an exemption by application. changes include those greater than the range of concentration given in the application or that remove non-listed chemical(s) given in the application as part of the formulation. a new application will be required only if reformulation results in a new product having a different commercial application or can no longer be defined as part of a group of exempted chemicals. dea must be notified of reformulation at least 30 days in advance of marketing the reformulated mixture. for a change in name or other designation, code, or any identifier, a written notification is required. dea must be notified of any changes at least 60 days in advance of the effective date for the change.
