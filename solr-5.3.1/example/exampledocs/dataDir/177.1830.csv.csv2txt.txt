styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymers. 
styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymers identified in this section may be safely used as components of plastic articles intended for use in contact with food, subject to the provisions of this section. 
(a) for the purpose of this section, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymers consist of basic copolymers produced by the copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate such that the finished basic copolymers contain more than 50 weight percent of polymer units derived from styrene. 
(b) the finished plastic food-contact article, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of intended use as determined from tables 1 and 2 of  176.170(c) of this chapter, yields extractives not to exceed the following when tested by the methods prescribed in  177.1010(c); 
(1) total nonvolatile extractives not to exceed 0.3 milligram per square inch of surface tested. 
(2) potassium permanganate oxidizable distilled water and 8 and 50 percent alcohol extractives not to exceed an absorbance of 0.15. 
(3) ultraviolet-absorbing distilled water and 8 and 50 percent alcohol extractives not to exceed an absorbance of 0.30. 
(4) ultraviolet-absorbing n- heptane extractives not to exceed an absorbance of 0.40.",
