ankle joint metal/composite semi-constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. an ankle joint metal/composite semi-constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace an ankle joint. the device limits translation and rotation: in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a talar resurfacing component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a tibial resurfacing component fabricated from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with carbon fibers composite, and is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class ii.",
