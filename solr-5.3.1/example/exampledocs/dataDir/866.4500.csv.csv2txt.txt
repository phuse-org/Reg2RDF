immunoelectrophoresis equipment. 
(a) identification. immunoelectrophoresis equipment for clinical use with its electrical power supply is a device used for separating protein molecules. immunoelectrophoresis is a procedure in which a complex protein mixture is placed in an agar gel and the various proteins are separated on the basis of their relative mobilities under the influence of an electric current. the separated proteins are then permitted to diffuse through the agar toward a multispecific antiserum, allowing precipitation and visualization of the separate complexes. 
(b) classification. class i (general controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in  866.9.
