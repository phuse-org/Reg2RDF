(b) to add or strengthen a statement about drug abuse, dependence, psychological effect, or overdosage; 
(c) to add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product; 
(d) to delete false, misleading, or unsupported indications for use or claims for effectiveness; or 
(e) any labeling change normally requiring a supplement submission and approval prior to distribution of the drug product that fda specifically requests be submitted under this provision. 
(7) if the agency disapproves the supplemental application, it may order the manufacturer to cease distribution of the drug product(s) made with the manufacturing change. 
(d) changes to be described in an annual report (minor changes). (1) changes in the drug substance, drug product, production process, quality controls, equipment, or facilities that have a minimal potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product must be documented by the applicant in the next annual report in accordance with  314.81(b)(2). 
(2) these changes include, but are not limited to: 
(i) any change made to comply with a change to an official compendium, except a change described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, that is consistent with fda statutory and regulatory requirements. 
(ii) the deletion or reduction of an ingredient intended to affect only the color of the drug product; 
(iii) replacement of equipment with that of the same design and operating principles except those equipment changes described in paragraph (c) of this section;

(vi) an extension of an expiration dating period based upon full shelf life data on production batches obtained from a protocol approved in the application; 
(vii) the addition or revision of an alternative analytical procedure that provides the same or increased assurance of the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the material being tested as the analytical procedure described in the approved application, or deletion of an alternative analytical procedure; 
(viii) the addition by embossing, debossing, or engraving of a code imprint to a solid oral dosage form drug product other than a modified release dosage form, or a minor change in an existing code imprint; 
(ix) a change in the labeling concerning the description of the drug product or in the information about how the drug product is supplied, that does not involve a change in the dosage strength or dosage form; and 
(x) an editorial or similar minor change in labeling, including a change to the information allowed by paragraphs (b)(2)(v)(c)( ) and ( ) of this section. 
(3) for changes under this category, the applicant is required to submit in the annual report: 
(i) a statement by the holder of the approved application that the effects of the change have been assessed; 
(ii) a full description of the manufacturing and controls changes, including the manufacturing site(s) or area(s) involved; 
(iii) the date each change was implemented; 
(iv) data from studies and tests performed to assess the effects of the change; and, 
(v) for a natural product, recombinant dna-derived protein/polypeptide, complex or conjugate of a drug substance with a monoclonal antibody, sterilization process or test methodology related to sterilization process validation, a cross-reference to relevant validation protocols and/or standard operating procedures. 
(e) protocols. an applicant may submit one or more protocols describing the specific tests and studies and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the lack of adverse effect for specified types of manufacturing changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. any such protocols, if not included in the approved application, or changes to an approved protocol, must be submitted as a supplement requiring approval from fda prior to distribution of a drug product produced with the manufacturing change. the supplement, if approved, may subsequently justify a reduced reporting category for the particular change because the use of the protocol for that type of change reduces the potential risk of an adverse effect. 
(f) patent information. the applicant must comply with the patent information requirements under section 505(c)(2) of the act. 
(g) claimed exclusivity. if an applicant claims exclusivity under  314.108 upon approval of a supplement for change to its previously approved drug product, the applicant must include with its supplement the information required under  314.50(j).
