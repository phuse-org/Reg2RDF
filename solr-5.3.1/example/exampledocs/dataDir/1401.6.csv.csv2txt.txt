expedited process. 
(a) requests and appeals will be given expedited treatment whenever ondcp determines either: 
(1) the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or 
(2) an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity occurs and the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information. 
(b) a request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at a later time. 
(c) a requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. a requester within the category in paragraph (a)(2) of this section also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. the formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion. 
(d) within ten days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, ondcp will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. if a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. if a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.",
