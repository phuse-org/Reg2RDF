transfers following importation. 
(a) in the case of a notice under  1313.12(a) submitted by a regulated person, if the transferee identified in the notice is not a regular customer, the importer may not transfer the listed chemical until after the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on the date on which the notice is submitted to the administration. 
(b) after a notice under  1313.12(a) or (d) is submitted to the administration, if circumstances change and the importer will not be transferring the listed chemical to the transferee identified in the notice, or will be transferring a greater quantity of the chemical than specified in the notice, the importer must update the notice to identify the most recent prospective transferee or the most recent quantity or both (as the case may be) and may not transfer the listed chemical until after the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on the date on which the update is submitted to the administration, except that the 15-day restriction does not apply if the prospective transferee identified in the update is a regular customer. the preceding sentence applies with respect to changing circumstances regarding a transferee or quantity identified in an update to the same extent and in the same manner as the sentence applies with respect to changing circumstances regarding a transferee or quantity identified in the original notice under  1313.12(a) or (d). 
(c) in the case of a transfer of a listed chemical that is subject to a 15-day restriction, the transferee involved shall, upon the expiration of the 15-day period, be considered to qualify as a regular customer, unless the administration otherwise notifies the importer involved in writing. 
(d) with respect to a transfer of a listed chemical with which a notice or update referred to in  1313.12(a) or (d) is concerned: 
(1) the administration 
(i) may, in accordance with the same procedures as apply under  1313.51 through 1313.57, order the suspension of the transfer of the listed chemical by the importer involved, except for a transfer to a regular customer, on the ground that the chemical may be diverted to the clandestine manufacture of a controlled substance (without regard to the form of the chemical that may be diverted, including the diversion of a finished drug product to be manufactured from bulk chemicals to be transferred), subject to the administration ordering the suspension before the expiration of the 15-day period with respect to the importation (in any case in which such a period applies); and 
(ii) may, for purposes of this paragraph (d), disqualify a regular customer on that ground. 
(2) from and after the time when the administration provides written notice of the order under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (including a statement of the legal and factual basis for the order) to the importer, the importer may not carry out the transfer. 
(e) for purposes of this section: 
(1) the term transfer, with respect to a listed chemical, includes the sale of the chemical. 
(2) the term transferee means a person to whom an importer transfers a listed chemical.
