ultraviolet radiation for the processing and treatment of food. 
ultraviolet radiation for the processing and treatment of food may be safely used under the following conditions: 
(a) the radiation sources consist of low pressure mercury lamps emitting 90 percent of the emission at a wavelength of 253.7 nanometers (2,537 angstroms). 
(b) the ultraviolet radiation is used or intended for use as follows: 
irradiated food limitations use food and food products without ozone production: high fat-content food irradiated in vacuum or in an inert atmosphere; intensity of radiation, 1 w (of 2,537 a. radiation) per 5 to 10 ft. surface microorganism control. potable water without ozone production; coefficient of absorption, 0.19 per cm or less; flow rate, 100 gal/h per watt of 2,537 a. radiation; water depth, 1 cm or less; lamp-operating temperature, 36 to 46 c. sterilization of water used in food production. juice products turbulent flow through tubes with a minimum reynolds number of 2,200. reduction of human pathogens and other microorganisms.
