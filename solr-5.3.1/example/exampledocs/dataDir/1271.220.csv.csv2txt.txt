processing and process controls. 
(a) general. if you are an establishment that processes hct/ps, you must process each hct/p in a way that does not cause contamination or cross-contamination during processing, and that prevents the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease through the use of the hct/p. 
(b) pooling. human cells or tissue from two or more donors must not be pooled (placed in physical contact or mixed in a single receptacle) during manufacturing. 
(c) in-process control and testing. you must ensure that specified requirements, consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, for in-process controls are met, and that each in-process hct/p is controlled until the required inspection and tests or other verification activities have been completed, or necessary approvals are received and documented. sampling of in-process hct/ps must be representative of the material to be evaluated. 
(d) dura mater. (1) when there is a published validated process that reduces the risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, you must use this process for dura mater (or an equivalent process that you have validated), unless following this process adversely affects the clinical utility of the dura mater. 
(2) when you use a published validated process, you must verify such a process in your establishment.",
