knee joint femorotibial (uni-compartmental) metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a knee joint femorotibial (uni-compartmental) metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. the device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surface. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device is designed to achieve biological fixation to bone without the use of bone cement. this identification includes fixed-bearing knee prostheses where the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene tibial bearing is rigidly secured to the metal tibial baseplate. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special control is fda's guidance: class ii special controls guidance document: knee joint patellofemorotibial and femorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prostheses; guidance for industry and fda. see  888.1 for the availability of this guidance.
