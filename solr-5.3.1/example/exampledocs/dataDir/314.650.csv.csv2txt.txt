termination of requirements. 
if fda determines after approval under this subpart that the requirements established in  314.610(b)(2), 314.620, and 314.630 are no longer necessary for the safe and effective use of a drug product, fda will so notify the applicant. ordinarily, for drug products approved under  314.610, these requirements will no longer apply when fda determines that the postmarketing study verifies and describes the drug product's clinical benefit. for drug products approved under  314.610, the restrictions would no longer apply when fda determines that safe use of the drug product can be ensured through appropriate labeling. fda also retains the discretion to remove specific postapproval requirements upon review of a petition submitted by the sponsor in accordance with  10.30 of this chapter.",
