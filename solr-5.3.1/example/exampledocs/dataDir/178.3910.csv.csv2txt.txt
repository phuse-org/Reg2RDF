general instructions because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. it is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent, residues, etc. examine all glassware including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. as a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. no grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. great care to avoid contamination of oil samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light. apparatus separatory funnels. 250-milliliter, 500-milliliter, 1,000-milliliter, and preferably 2,000-milliliter capacity, equipped with tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks. evaporation flask optional ). 250-milliliter or 500-milliliter capacity all-glass flask equipped with standard-taper stopper having inlet and outlet tubes to permit passage of nitrogen across the surface of contained liquid to be evaporated. spectrophotometric cells. fused quartz cells, optical path length in the range of 5,000 centimeters 0.005 centimeter;
