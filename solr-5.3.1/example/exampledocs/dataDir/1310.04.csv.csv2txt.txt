(c) a record under this section shall be kept at the regulated person's place of business where the transaction occurred, except that records may be kept at a single, central location of the regulated person if the regulated person has notified the administration of the intention to do so. written notification must be submitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the special agent in charge of the dea divisional office for the area in which the records are required to be kept.

(f) for those listed chemicals for which thresholds have been established, the quantitative threshold or the cumulative amount for multiple transactions within a calendar month, to be utilized in determining whether a receipt, sale, importation or exportation is a regulated transaction is as follows: 
(1) list i chemicals: 
(i) except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the following thresholds have been established for list i chemicals. 
code chemical threshold by base weight 8522 n-acetylanthranilic acid, its esters, and its salts 40 kilograms. 8530 anthranilic acid, its esters, and its salts 30 kilograms. 8256 benzaldehyde 4 kilograms. 8735 benzyl cyanide 1 kilogram. 8675 ergonovine and its salts 10 grams. 8676 ergotamine and its salts 20 grams. 8678 ethylamine and its salts 1 kilogram. 6695 hydriodic acid 1.7 kilograms (or 1 liter by volume). 8704 isosafrole 4 kilograms. 8520 methylamine and its salts 1 kilogram. 8502 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone 4 kilograms. 8115 n-methylephedrine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers 1 kilogram. 8119 n-methylpseudoephedrine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers 1 kilogram. 6724 nitroethane 2.5 kilograms. 8317 norpseudoephedrine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers 2.5 kilograms. 8791 phenylacetic acid, its esters, and its salts 1 kilogram. 2704 piperidine and its salts 500 grams. 8750 piperonal (also called heliotropine) 4 kilograms. 8328 propionic anhydride 1 gram. 8323 safrole 4 kilograms. 
(ii) for list i chemicals that are contained in scheduled listed chemical products as defined in  1300.02 of this chapter, the thresholds established in paragraph (g) of this section apply only to non-retail distribution, import, and export. sales of these products at retail are subject to the requirements of part 1314 of this chapter. 
(2) list ii chemicals: 
(i) imports and exports 
chemical threshold by volume threshold by weight (a) acetic anhydride 250 gallons 1,023 kilograms. (b) acetone 500 gallons 1,500 kilograms. (c) benzyl chloride n/a 4 kilograms. (d) ethyl ether 500 gallons 1,364 kilograms. (e) potassium permanganate n/a 500 kilograms. (f) 2-butanone (mek) 500 gallons 1,455 kilograms. (g) toluene 500 gallons 1,591 kilograms. (h) sodium permanganate n/a 500 kilograms 
(ii) domestic sales 
chemical threshold by volume threshold by weight (a) acetic anhydride 250 gallons 1,023 kilograms. (b) acetone 50 gallons 150 kilograms. (c) benzyl chloride n/a 1 kilogram. (d) ethyl ether 50 gallons 135.8 kilograms. (e) potassium permanganate n/a 55 kilograms. (f) 2-butanone (mek) 50 gallons 145 kilograms. (g) toluene 50 gallons 159 kilograms. (h) anhydrous hydrogen chloride n/a 0.0 kilograms. (i) sodium permanganate n/a 55 kilograms 
(iii) the cumulative threshold is not applicable to domestic sales of acetone, 2-butanone (mek), and toluene. 
(iv) exports, transshipments and international transactions to designated countries as set forth in  1310.08(b). 
chemical threshold by volume threshold by weight (a) hydrochloric acid 50 gallons ) anhydrous hydrogen chloride 27 kilograms. (b) sulfuric acid 50 gallons 
(v) export and international transactions to designated countries, and importations for transshipment or transfer to designated countries 
chemical threshold by volume threshold by weight (a) methyl isobutyl ketone (mibk) 500 gallons 1523 kilograms. (b) reserved. 
(g) for listed chemicals for which no thresholds have been established, the size of the transaction is not a factor in determining whether the transaction meets the definition of a regulated transaction as set forth in  1300.02 of this chapter. all such transactions, regardless of size, are subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements as set forth in this part and notification provisions as set forth in part 1313 of this chapter. 
(1) listed chemicals for which no thresholds have been established: 
(i) ephedrine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers; 
(ii) ergocristine and its salts 
(iii) gamma-butyrolactone (other names include: gbl; dihydro-2(3h)-furanone; 1,2-butanolide; 1,4-butanolide; 4-hydroxybutanoic acid lactone; gamma-hydroxybutyric acid lactone) 
(iv) hypophosphorous acid and its salts (including ammonium hypophosphite, calcium hypophosphite, iron hypophosphite, potassium hypophosphite, manganese hypophosphite, magnesium hypophosphite, and sodium hypophosphite) 
(v) iodine 
(vi) n-phenethyl-4-piperidone (npp) 
(vii) pseudoephedrine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers 
(viii) phenylpropanolamine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers 
(ix) red phosphorus 
(x) white phosphorus (other names: yellow phosphorus) 
(2) [reserved] 
(h) the thresholds and conditions in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section will apply to transactions involving regulated chemical mixtures. for purposes of determining whether the weight or volume of a chemical mixture meets or exceeds the applicable quantitative threshold, the following rules apply: 
(1) for chemical mixtures containing list i chemicals or list ii chemicals other than those in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the threshold is determined by the weight of the listed chemical in the chemical mixture. 
(2) for the list ii chemicals acetone, ethyl ether, 2-butanone, toluene, and methyl isobutyl ketone, the threshold is determined by the weight of the entire chemical mixture. 
(3) if two or more listed chemicals are present in a chemical mixture, and the quantity of any of these chemicals equals or exceeds the threshold applicable to that chemical, then the transaction is regulated.
