(iii) legible reproductions (color optional) of all labels and hazard warnings required by paragraph (g) of this section and  1040.11 to be affixed to the laser product or provided with the laser product, including the information required for positions 1, 2, and 3 of the applicable logotype (figure 1 of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) or figure 2 or paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section). the corresponding position of each label affixed to the product shall be indicated or, if provided with the product, a statement that such labels could not be affixed to the product but were supplied with the product and a statement of the form and manner in which they were supplied shall be provided. 
(iv) a listing of all controls, adjustments, and procedures for operation and maintenance, including the warning cautionuse of controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure. 
(v) in the case of laser products other than laser systems, a statment of the compatibility requirements for a laser energy source that will assure compliance of the laser product with this section and  1040.11. 
(vi) in the case of laser products classified with a 7 millimeter diameter aperture stop as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, if the use of a 50 millimeter diameter aperture stop would result in a higher classification of the product, the following warning shall be included in the user information: cautionthe use of optical instruments with this product will increase eye hazard. 
(2) purchasing and servicing information. manufacturers of laser products shall provide or cause to be provided: 
(i) in all catalogs, specification sheets, and descriptive brochures pertaining to each laser product, a legible reproduction (color optional) of the class designation and warning required by paragraph (g) of this section to be affixed to that product, including the information required for positions 1, 2, and 3 of the applicable logotype (figure 1 of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) or figure 2 of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section). 
(ii) to servicing dealers and distributors and to others upon request at a cost not to exceed the cost of preparation and distribution, adequate instructions for service adjustments and service procedures for each laser product model, including clear warnings and precautions to be taken to avoid possible exposure to laser and collateral radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits in tables i, ii-a, ii, iii-a, iii-b, and vi of paragraph (d) of this section, and a schedule of maintenance necessary to keep the product in compliance with this section and  1040.11; and in all such service instructions, a listing of those controls and procedures that could be utilized by persons other than the manufacturers or the manufacturer's agents to increase accessible emission levels of radiation and a clear description of the location of displaceable portions of the protective housing that could allow human access to laser or collateral radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits in tables i, ii-a, ii, iii-a, iii-b, and vi of paragraph (d) of this section. the instructions shall include protective procedures for service personnel to avoid exposure to levels of laser and collateral radiation known to be hazardous for each procedure or sequence of procedures to be accomplished, and legible reproductions (color optional) of required labels and hazard warnings. 
(i) modification of a certified product. the modification of a laser product, previously certified under  1010.2, by any person engaged in the business of manufacturing, assembling, or modifying laser products shall be construed as manufacturing under the act if the modification affects any aspect of the product's performance or intended function(s) for which this section and  1040.11 have an applicable requirement. the manufacturer who performs such modification shall recertify and reidentify the product in accordance with the provisions of  1010.2. and 1010.3. 
(the information collection requirements contained in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) were approved by the office of management and budget under control number 0910-0176)
