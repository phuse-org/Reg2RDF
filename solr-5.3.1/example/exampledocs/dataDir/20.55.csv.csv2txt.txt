indexing trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information. 
whenever the food and drug administration denies a request for a record or portion thereof on the grounds that the record or portion thereof is exempt from public disclosure as trade secret or confidential commercial or financial data and information under  20.61, and the person requesting the record subsequently contests the denial in the courts, the food and drug administration will so inform the person affected, i.e., the person who submitted the record, and will require that such person intervene to defend the exempt status of the record. if a court requires the food and drug administration to itemize and index such records, the food and drug administration will so inform the person affected and will require that such person undertake the itemization and indexing of the records. if the affected person fails to intervene to defend the exempt status of the records and to itemize and index the disputed records, the food and drug administration will take this failure into consideration in deciding whether that person has waived such exemption so as to require the food and drug administration to promptly make the records available for public disclosure.
