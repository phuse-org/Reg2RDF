tin-coated lead foil capsules for wine bottles. 
(a) tin-coated lead foil is composed of a lead foil coated on one or both sides with a thin layer of tin. tin-coated lead foil has been used as a capsule (i.e., as a covering applied over the cork and neck areas) on wine bottles to prevent insect infestation, as a barrier to oxygen, and for decorative purposes. information received by the food and drug administration establishes that the use of such a capsule on wine bottles may reasonably be expected to result in lead becoming a component of the wine. 
(b) the capping of any bottles of wine after february 8, 1996, with a tin-coated lead foil capsule renders the wine adulterated and in violation of section 402(a)(2)(c) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act because lead from the capsule, which is an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 of the act, may reasonably be expected to become a component of the wine.
