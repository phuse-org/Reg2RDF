nonspecific and overly burdensome requests. 
the food and drug administration will make every reasonable effort to comply fully with all requests for disclosure of nonexempt records. nonspecific requests or requests for a large number of documents that require the deployment of a substantial amount of agency man-hours to search for and compile will be processed taking into account the staff-hours required, the tasks from which these resources must be diverted, the impact that this diversion will have upon the agency's consumer protection activities, and the public policy reasons justifying the requests. a decision on the processing of such a request for information shall be made after balancing the public benefit to be gained by the disclosure against the public loss that will result from diverting agency personnel from their other responsibilities. in any situation in which it is determined that a request for voluminous records would unduly burden and interfere with the operations of the food and drug administration, the person making the request will be asked to be more specific and to narrow the request, and to agree on an orderly procedure for the production of the requested records, in order to satisfy the request without disproportionate adverse effects on agency operations.
