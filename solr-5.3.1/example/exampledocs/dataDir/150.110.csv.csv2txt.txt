(c) the following safe and suitable optional ingredients may be used: 
(1) nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners. 
(2) spice. 
(3) flavoring (other than artificial flavoring).

(1980), section 31.011, under solids by means of refractometerofficial final action, which is incorporated by reference; the weight of diluted concentrated juice from any other fruits is the original weight of the juice before it was diluted or concentrated. the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. 
(e)(1) label declaration. each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that:
