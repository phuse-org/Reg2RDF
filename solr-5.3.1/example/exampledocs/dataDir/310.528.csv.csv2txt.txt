drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter (otc) for use as an aphrodisiac. 
(a) any product that bears labeling claims that it will arouse or increase sexual desire, or that it will improve sexual performance, is an aphrodisiac drug product. anise, cantharides, don qual, estrogens, fennel, ginseng, golden seal, gotu kola, korean ginseng, licorice, mandrake, methyltestosterone, minerals, nux vomica, pega palo, sarsaparilla, strychnine, testosterone, vitamins, yohimbine, yohimbine hydrochloride, and yohimbinum have been present as ingredients in such drug products. androgens (e.g., testosterone and methyltestosterone) and estrogens are powerful hormones when administered internally and are not safe for use except under the supervision of a physician. there is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of any of these ingredients, or any other ingredient, for otc use as an aphrodisiac. labeling claims for aphrodisiacs for otc use are either false, misleading, or unsupported by scientific data. the following claims are examples of some that have been made for aphrodisiac drug products for otc use: acts as an aphrodisiac; arouses or increases sexual desire and improves sexual performance; helps restore sexual vigor, potency, and performance; improves performance, staying power, and sexual potency; and builds virility and sexual potency. based on evidence currently available, any otc drug product containing ingredients for use as an aphrodisiac cannot be generally recognized as safe and effective. 
(b) any otc drug product that is labeled, represented, or prompted for use as an aphrodisiac is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, (the act), for which an approved new drug application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. in the absence of an approved new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act. 
(c) clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted for otc use as an aphrodisiac is safe and effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter. 
(d) after january 8, 1990, any such otc drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.
