knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis is a device made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. the device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a femoral component with or without protuberance(s) for the enhancement of fixation and is limited to those prostheses intended for use without bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class iii. 
(c) date pma or notice of completion of a pdp is required. a pma or a notice of completion of a pdp is required to be filed with the food and drug administration on or before december 26, 1996 for any knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976, or that has, on or before december 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976. any other knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis shall have an approved pma or a declared completed pdp in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
