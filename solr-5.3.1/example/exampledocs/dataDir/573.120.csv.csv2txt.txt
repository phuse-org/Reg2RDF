acrylamide-acrylic acid resin. 
acrylamide-acrylic acid resin (hydrolized polyacrylamide), only for the purposes of this section as described below, may be safely used in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 
(a) the additive is produced by polymerization of acrylamide with partial hydrolysis, or by copolymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid with the greater part of the polymer being composed of acrylamide units. 
(b) the additive meets the following specifications: 
(1) a minimum molecular weight of 3 million. 
(2) viscosity range: 3,000 to 6,000 centipoises at 77 f in a 1 percent aqueous solution as determined by lvf brookfield viscometer or equivalent using a number 6 spindle at 20 r.p.m. 
(3) residual acrylamide: not more than 0.05 percent. 
(c) it is used as a thickener and suspending agent in nonmedicated aqueous suspensions intended for addition to animal feeds.
