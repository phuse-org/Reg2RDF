drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter (otc) for external use as hair growers or for hair loss prevention.

(c) clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted for otc external use as a hair grower or for hair loss prevention is safe and effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter. 
(d) after january 8, 1990, any such otc drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.
