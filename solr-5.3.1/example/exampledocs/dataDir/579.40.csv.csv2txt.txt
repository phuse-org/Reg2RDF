ionizing radiation for the treatment of poultry feed and poultry feed ingredients. 
ionizing radiation for the treatment of complete poultry diets and poultry feed ingredients may be safely used as follows: 
(a) energy sources. ionizing radiation is limited to: 
(1) gamma rays from sealed units of cobalt-60 or cesium-137; 
(2) electrons generated from machine sources at energy levels not to exceed 10 million electron volts (mev); 
(3) x-rays generated from machine sources at energies not to exceed 5 mev, except as permitted by  179.26(a)(4) of this chapter; or 
(4) x-rays generated from machine sources using tantalum or gold as the target material and using energies not to exceed 7.5 mev. 
(b) limitation. the ionizing radiation is used for feed or feed ingredients that do not contain drugs. 
(c) use. ionizing radiation is used as a single treatment for rendering complete poultry diets or poultry feed ingredients salmonella negative as follows: 
(1) minimum dose 2.0 kilograys (kgy) (0.2 megarad (mrad)); maximum dose 25 kgy (2.5 megarads mrad). the absorbed dose of irradiation is to be based on initial concentration of salmonella using the relationship that 1.0 kgy (0.1 mrad) reduces salmonella concentration by one log cycle (one decimal reduction). 
(2) feeds treated by irradiation should be formulated to account for nutritional loss. 
(3) if an irradiated feed ingredient is less than 5 percent of the final product, the final product can be irradiated without being considered to be reirradiated.
