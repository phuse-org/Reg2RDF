(c) fill of container. (1) the standard of fill of container for canned salmon is a fill including all the contents of the container and is not less than the minimum net weight specified for the corresponding can size in the following table: 
i. can size ii. minimum net weight 603405 1.814 kg (64 oz). 301411 454 g (16 oz). 301408 439 g (15 1/2 oz). 401211 439 g (15 1/2 oz). 607406108 439 g (15 1/2 oz). 301308 340 g (12 oz). 307200.25 220 g (7 3/4 oz). 513307103 220 g (7 3/4 oz). 307113 191 g (6 3/4 oz). 301106 106 g (3 3/4 oz). 407213015 106 g (3 3/4 oz).
