effective dates of requirement for premarket approval. 
a device included in this part that is classified into class iii (premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). an approval under section 515 of the act consists of fda's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (pma) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (pdp) for the device. 
(a) before fda requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act fda must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class iii is effective, whichever is later. see section 501(f)(2)(b) of the act. accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class iii in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without fda's issuance of an order approving a pma or declaring completed a pdp for the device. if fda promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(a) of the act applies to the device. 
(b) any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after may 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class iii without any grace period and fda must have issued an order approving a pma or declaring completed a pdp for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. if fda knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a new device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, fda may codify the statutory classification of the device into class iii for such new use. accordingly, the regulation for such a class iii device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, may 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.
