(1) the type of activity conducted (e.g., processing of bulk chemicals, preparing dosage forms, packaging, labeling, cooperative buying, etc.); 
(2) the type and form of controlled substances handled (e.g., bulk liquids or dosage units, usable powders or nonusable powders); 
(3) the quantity of controlled substances handled; 
(4) the location of the premises and the relationship such location bears on security needs; 
(5) the type of building construction comprising the facility and the general characteristics of the building or buildings; 
(6) the type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures or other storage system (e.g., automatic storage and retrieval system) used; 
(7) the type of closures on vaults, safes, and secure enclosures;

(c) when physical security controls become inadequate as a result of a controlled substance being transferred to a different schedule, or as a result of a noncontrolled substance being listed on any schedule, or as a result of a significant increase in the quantity of controlled substances in the possession of the registrant during normal business operations, the physical security controls shall be expanded and extended accordingly. a registrant may adjust physical security controls within the requirements set forth in  1301.72-1301.76 when the need for such controls decreases as a result of a controlled substance being transferred to a different schedule, or a result of a controlled substance being removed from control, or as a result of a significant decrease in the quantity of controlled substances in the possession of the registrant during normal business operations. 
(d) any registrant or applicant desiring to determine whether a proposed security system substantially complies with, or is the structural equivalent of, the requirements set forth in  1301.72-1301.76 may submit any plans, blueprints, sketches or other materials regarding the proposed security system either to the special agent in charge in the region in which the system will be used, or to the regulatory section, drug enforcement administration. see the table of dea mailing addresses in  1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address.
