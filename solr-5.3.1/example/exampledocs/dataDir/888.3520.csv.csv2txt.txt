knee joint femorotibial metal/polymer non-constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a knee joint femorotibial metal/polymer non-constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. the device limits minimally (less than normal anatomic constraints) translation in one or more planes. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that have a femoral condylar resurfacing component or components made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a tibial component or components made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and are intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class ii.",
