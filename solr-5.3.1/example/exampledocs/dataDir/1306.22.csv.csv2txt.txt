(4) the prescribing practitioner must execute a new and separate prescription for any additional quantities beyond the five-refill, six-month limitation. 
(f) as an alternative to the procedures provided by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, a computer application may be used for the storage and retrieval of refill information for original paper prescription orders for controlled substances in schedule iii and iv, subject to the following conditions: 
(1) any such proposed computerized application must provide online retrieval (via computer monitor or hard-copy printout) of original prescription order information for those prescription orders that are currently authorized for refilling. this shall include, but is not limited to, data such as the original prescription number; date of issuance of the original prescription order by the practitioner; full name and address of the patient; name, address, and dea registration number of the practitioner; and the name, strength, dosage form, quantity of the controlled substance prescribed (and quantity dispensed if different from the quantity prescribed), and the total number of refills authorized by the prescribing practitioner. 
(2) any such proposed computerized application must also provide online retrieval (via computer monitor or hard-copy printout) of the current refill history for schedule iii or iv controlled substance prescription orders (those authorized for refill during the past six months). this refill history shall include, but is not limited to, the name of the controlled substance, the date of refill, the quantity dispensed, the identification code, or name or initials of the dispensing pharmacist for each refill and the total number of refills dispensed to date for that prescription order. 
(3) documentation of the fact that the refill information entered into the computer each time a pharmacist refills an original paper, fax, or oral prescription order for a schedule iii or iv controlled substance is correct must be provided by the individual pharmacist who makes use of such an application. if such an application provides a hard-copy printout of each day's controlled substance prescription order refill data, that printout shall be verified, dated, and signed by the individual pharmacist who refilled such a prescription order. the individual pharmacist must verify that the data indicated are correct and then sign this document in the same manner as he would sign a check or legal document (e.g., j.h. smith, or john h. smith). this document shall be maintained in a separate file at that pharmacy for a period of two years from the dispensing date. this printout of the day's controlled substance prescription order refill data must be provided to each pharmacy using such a computerized application within 72 hours of the date on which the refill was dispensed. it must be verified and signed by each pharmacist who is involved with such dispensing. in lieu of such a printout, the pharmacy shall maintain a bound log book, or separate file, in which each individual pharmacist involved in such dispensing shall sign a statement (in the manner previously described) each day, attesting to the fact that the refill information entered into the computer that day has been reviewed by him and is correct as shown. such a book or file must be maintained at the pharmacy employing such an application for a period of two years after the date of dispensing the appropriately authorized refill. 
(4) any such computerized application shall have the capability of producing a printout of any refill data that the user pharmacy is responsible for maintaining under the act and its implementing regulations. for example, this would include a refill-by-refill audit trail for any specified strength and dosage form of any controlled substance (by either brand or generic name or both). such a printout must include name of the prescribing practitioner, name and address of the patient, quantity dispensed on each refill, date of dispensing for each refill, name or identification code of the dispensing pharmacist, and the number of the original prescription order. in any computerized application employed by a user pharmacy the central recordkeeping location must be capable of sending the printout to the pharmacy within 48 hours, and if a dea special agent or diversion investigator requests a copy of such printout from the user pharmacy, it must, if requested to do so by the agent or investigator, verify the printout transmittal capability of its application by documentation (e.g., postmark). 
(5) in the event that a pharmacy which employs such a computerized application experiences system down-time, the pharmacy must have an auxiliary procedure which will be used for documentation of refills of schedule iii and iv controlled substance prescription orders. this auxiliary procedure must ensure that refills are authorized by the original prescription order, that the maximum number of refills has not been exceeded, and that all of the appropriate data are retained for online data entry as soon as the computer system is available for use again. 
(g) when filing refill information for original paper, fax, or oral prescription orders for schedule iii or iv controlled substances, a pharmacy may use only one of the two applications described in paragraphs (a) through (e) or (f) of this section. 
(h) when filing refill information for electronic prescriptions, a pharmacy must use an application that meets the requirements of part 1311 of this chapter.
