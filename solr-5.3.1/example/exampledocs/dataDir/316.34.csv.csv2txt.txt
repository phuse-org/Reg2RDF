fda recognition of exclusive approval. 
(a) fda will send the sponsor (or, the permanent-resident agent, if applicable) timely written notice recognizing exclusive approval once the marketing application for a designated orphan-drug product has been approved, if the same drug has not already been approved for the same use or indication. the written notice will inform the sponsor of the requirements for maintaining orphan-drug exclusive approval for the full 7-year term of exclusive approval. 
(b) when a marketing application is approved under section 505 of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (21 u.s.c. 355) for a designated orphan drug that qualifies for exclusive approval, fda will publish in its publication entitled approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations information identifying the sponsor, the drug, and the date of termination of the orphan-drug exclusive approval. a subscription to this publication and its monthly cumulative supplements is available from the superintendent of documents, government printing office, washington, dc 20402-9325, and is also available online at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm. 
(c) if a drug is otherwise the same drug as a previously approved drug for the same use or indication, fda will not recognize orphan-drug exclusive approval if the sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the drug is clinically superior to the previously approved drug.
