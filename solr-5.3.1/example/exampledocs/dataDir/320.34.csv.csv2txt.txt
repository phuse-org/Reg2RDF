requirements for batch testing and certification by the food and drug administration. 
(a) if the commissioner determines that individual batch testing by the food and drug administration is necessary to assure that all batches of the same drug product meet an appropriate in vitro test, he shall include in the bioequivalence requirement a requirement for manufacturers to submit samples of each batch to the food and drug administration and to withhold distribution of the batch until notified by the food and drug administration that the batch may be introduced into interstate commerce. 
(b) the commissioner will ordinarily terminate a requirement for a manufacturer to submit samples for batch testing on a finding that the manufacturer has produced four consecutive batches that were tested by the food and drug administration and found to meet the bioequivalence requirement, unless the public health requires that batch testing be extended to additional batches.
