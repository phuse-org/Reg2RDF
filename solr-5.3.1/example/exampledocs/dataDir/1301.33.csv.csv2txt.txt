application for bulk manufacture of schedule i and ii substances. 
(a) in the case of an application for registration or reregistration to manufacture in bulk a basic class of controlled substance listed in schedule i or ii, the administrator shall, upon the filing of such application, publish in the federal register a notice naming the applicant and stating that such applicant has applied to be registered as a bulk manufacturer of a basic class of narcotic or nonnarcotic controlled substance, which class shall be identified. a copy of said notice shall be mailed simultaneously to each person registered as a bulk manufacturer of that basic class and to any other applicant therefor. any such person may, within 60 days from the date of publication of the notice in the federal register, file with the administrator written comments on or objections to the issuance of the proposed registration. 
(b) in order to provide adequate competition, the administrator shall not be required to limit the number of manufacturers in any basic class to a number less than that consistent with maintenance of effective controls against diversion solely because a smaller number is capable of producing an adequate and uninterrupted supply. 
(c) this section shall not apply to the manufacture of basic classes of controlled substances listed in schedules i or ii as an incident to research or chemical analysis as authorized in  1301.13(e)(1).
