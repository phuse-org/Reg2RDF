rocket immunoelectro-phoresis equipment. 
(a) identification. rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment for clinical use is a device used to perform a specific test on proteins by using a procedure called rocket immunoelectrophoresis. in this procedure, an electric current causes the protein in solution to migrate through agar gel containing specific antisera. the protein precipitates with the antisera in a rocket-shaped pattern, giving the name to the device. the height of the peak (or the area under the peak) is proportional to the concentration of the protein. 
(b) classification. class i (general controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in  866.9.
