confidentiality and use of data and information submitted in connection with classification and reclassification. 
(a) this section governs the availability for public disclosure and the use by the commissioner of data and information submitted to classification panels or to the commissioner in connection with the classification or reclassification of devices under this part. 
(b) in general, data and information submitted to classification panels in connection with the classification of devices under  860.84 will be available immediately for public disclosure upon request. however, except as provided by the special rules in paragraph (c) of this section, this provision does not apply to data and information exempt from public disclosure in accordance with part 20 of this chapter: such data and information will be available only in accordance with part 20. 
(c)(1) safety and effectiveness data submitted to classification panels or to the commissioner in connection with the classification of a device under  860.84, which have not been disclosed previously to the public, as described in  20.81 of this chapter, shall be regarded as confidential if the device is classified in to class iii. because the classification of a device under  860.84 may be ascertained only upon publication of a final regulation, all safety and effectiveness data that have not been disclosed previously are not available for public disclosure unless and until the device is classified into class i or ii, in which case the procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. 
(2) thirty days after publication of a final regulation under  860.84 classifying a device into class i or class ii, safety and effectiveness data submitted for that device that had been regarded as confidential under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be available for public disclosure and placed on public display in the office of the division of dockets management, food and drug administration unless, within that 30-day period, the person who submitted the data demonstrates that the data still fall within the exemption for trade secrets and confidential commercial information described in  20.61 of this chapter. safety and effectiveness data submitted for a device that is classified into class iii by regulation in accordance with  860.84 will remain confidential and unavailable for public disclosure so long as such data have not been disclosed to the public as described in  20.81 of this chapter. 
(3) because device classification affects generic types of devices, in making determinations under  860.84 concerning the initial classification of a device, the classification panels and the commissioner may consider safety and effectiveness data developed for another device in the same generic type, regardless of whether such data are regarded currently as confidential under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 
(d)(1) the fact of its existence and the contents of a petition for reclassification filed in accordance with  860.130 or  860.132 are available for public disclosure at the time the petition is received by the food and drug administration. 
(2) the fact of the existence of a petition for reclassification filed in accordance with  860.134 or  860.136 is available for public disclosure at the time the petition is received by the food and drug administration. the contents of such a petition are not available for public disclosure for the period of time following its receipt (not longer than 30 days) during which the petition is reviewed for any deficiencies preventing the commissioner from making a decision on it. once it is determined that the petition contains no deficiencies preventing the commissioner from making a decision on it, the petition will be filed with the division of dockets management and its entire contents will be available for public disclosure and subject to consideration by classification panels and by the commissioner in making a decision on the petition. if, during this 30-day period of time, the petition is found to contain deficiencies that prevent the commissioner from making a decision on it, the petitioner will be so notified and afforded an opportunity to correct the deficiencies. 
thirty days after notice to the petitioner of deficiencies in the petition, the contents of the petition will be available for public disclosure unless, within that 30 days, the petitioner submits supplemental material intended to correct the deficiencies in the petition. the commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, may allow withdrawal of a deficient petition during the 30-day period provided for correcting deficiencies. any supplemental material submitted by the petitioner, together with the material in the original petition, is considered as a new petition. the new petition is reviewed for deficiencies in the same manner as the original petition, and the same procedures for notification and correction of deficiencies are followed. once the petitioner has corrected the deficiencies, the entire contents of the petition will be available for public disclosure and subject to consideration by classification panels and by the commissioner in making a decision on the petition. deficient petitions which have not been corrected within 180 days after notification of deficiency will be returned to the petitioner and will not be considered further unless resubmitted. 
(e) the commissioner may not disclose, or use as the basis for reclassification of a device from class iii to class ii, any information reported to or otherwise obtained by the commissioner under section 513, 514, 515, 516, 518, 519, 520(f), 520(g), or 704 of the act that falls within the exemption described in  20.61 of this chapter for trade secrets and confidential commercial information. the exemption described in  20.61 does not apply to data or information contained in a petition for reclassification submitted in accordance with  860.130 or  860.132, or in a petition submitted in accordance with  860.134 or  860.136 that has been determined to contain no deficiencies that prevent the commissioner from making a decision on it. accordingly, all data and information contained in such petitions may be disclosed by the commissioner and used as the basis for reclassification of a device from class iii to class ii. 
(f) for purposes of this section, safety and effectiveness data include data and results derived from all studies and tests of a device on animals and humans and from all studies and tests of the device itself intended to establish or determine its safety and effectiveness.",
