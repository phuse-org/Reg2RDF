requirements for submission of bioavailability and bioequivalence data. 
(a) any person submitting a full new drug application to the food and drug administration (fda) shall include in the application either: 
(1) evidence measuring the in vivo bioavailability of the drug product that is the subject of the application; or 
(2) information to permit fda to waive the submission of evidence measuring in vivo bioavailability. 
(b) any person submitting an abbreviated new drug application to fda shall include in the application either: 
(1) evidence demonstrating that the drug product that is the subject of the abbreviated new drug application is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug (defined in  314.3(b) of this chapter). a complete study report must be submitted for the bioequivalence study upon which the applicant relies for approval. for all other bioequivalence studies conducted on the same drug product formulation, the applicant must submit either a complete or summary report. if a summary report of a bioequivalence study is submitted and fda determines that there may be bioequivalence issues or concerns with the product, fda may require that the applicant submit a complete report of the bioequivalence study to fda; or 
(2) information to show that the drug product is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug which would permit fda to waive the submission of evidence demonstrating in vivo bioequivalence as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. 
(c) any person submitting a supplemental application to fda shall include in the supplemental application the evidence or information set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the supplemental application proposes any of the following changes: 
(1) a change in the manufacturing site or a change in the manufacturing process, including a change in product formulation or dosage strength, beyond the variations provided for in the approved application. 
(2) a change in the labeling to provide for a new indication for use of the drug product, if clinical studies are required to support the new indication for use. 
(3) a change in the labeling to provide for a new dosage regimen or for an additional dosage regimen for a special patient population, e.g., infants, if clinical studies are required to support the new or additional dosage regimen. 
(d) fda may approve a full new drug application, or a supplemental application proposing any of the changes set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, that does not contain evidence of in vivo bioavailability or information to permit waiver of the requirement for in vivo bioavailability data, if all of the following conditions are met. 
(1) the application is otherwise approvable. 
(2) the application agrees to submit, within the time specified by fda, either: 
(i) evidence measuring the in vivo bioavailability and demonstrating the in vivo bioequivalence of the drug product that is the subject of the application; or 
(ii) information to permit fda to waive measurement of in vivo bioavailability. 
(e) evidence measuring the in vivo bioavailability and demonstrating the in vivo bioequivalence of a drug product shall be obtained using one of the approaches for determining bioavailability set forth in  320.24. 
(f) information to permit fda to waive the submission of evidence measuring the in vivo bioavailability or demonstrating the in vivo bioequivalence shall meet the criteria set forth in  320.22. 
(g) any person holding an approved full or abbreviated new drug application shall submit to fda a supplemental application containing new evidence measuring the in vivo bioavailability or demonstrating the in vivo bioequivalence of the drug product that is the subject of the application if notified by fda that: 
(1) there are data demonstrating that the dosage regimen in the labeling is based on incorrect assumptions or facts regarding the pharmacokinetics of the drug product and that following this dosage regimen could potentially result in subtherapeutic or toxic levels; or 
(2) there are data measuring significant intra-batch and batch-to-batch variability, e.g., plus or minus 25 percent, in the bioavailability of the drug product. 
(h) the requirements of this section regarding the submission of evidence measuring the in vivo bioavailability or demonstrating the in vivo bioequivalence apply only to a full or abbreviated new drug application or a supplemental application for a finished dosage formulation.
