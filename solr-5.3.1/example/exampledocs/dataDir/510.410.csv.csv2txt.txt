(a) the food and drug administration has received reports of side effects associated with the oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use of corticosteroid animal drugs. the use of these drugs administered orally or by injection has resulted in premature parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy. premature parturition may be followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. additionally, corticosteroids used in dogs, rabbits, and rodents during pregnancy have produced cleft palate in offspring. use in dogs has resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca. drugs subject to this section are required to carry the veterinary prescription legend and are subject to the labeling requirements of  201.105 of this chapter. 
(b) in view of these potentially serious side effects, the food and drug administration has concluded that the labeling on or within packaged corticosteroid-containing preparations intended for animal use shall bear conspicuously the following warning statement: 
warning: clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to animals may induce the first stage of parturition if used during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits, and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring. corticosteroids administered to dogs during pregnancy have also resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca.
