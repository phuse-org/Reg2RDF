(2) sampling and acceptance. determine compliance as specified in  145.3(o). 
(3) methodology. the method to be employed to determine whether canned pineapple meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section are as follows: 
(i) determine the drained weight of the canned pineapple by the procedure prescribed in  145.3(n). 
(ii) identify and separate any core material cleanly from each of the units in the container, and weigh the aggregate of the core material. calculate the percent core material to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. 
(iii) in the case of slices, half slices, quarter slices, spears, tidbits, chunks, and pieces, check the weight of the units against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), and ( ) of this section. 
(iv) in the case of broken slices, check the dimensions of each unit against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)( ) of this section. 
(v) in the case of cubes, and pieces, determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) ( ) and ( ) of this section by placing the units, a few at a time, on the mesh of a u.s. standard no. 8 sieve (8-millimeter (0.31 inch)) mesh. after shaking gently, remove those units that remain on the sieve before testing the next portion. continue portion-wise until all units are tested, then determine the aggregate weight of those units that have passed through the sieve. 
(vi) except in the case of crushed pineapple, segregate and count each unit that is blemished as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. in the case of crushed pineapple, segregate each fragment of crushed pineapple bearing a blemish and determine the aggregate weight of such fragments to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii)( ) of this section. 
(vii) except in the case of chunks, cubes, pieces, and crushed pineapple, inspect all the units in the container to determine those that have been excessively trimmed, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. 
(viii) except in the case of cubes, pieces, and crushed pineapple, count the total units in the container and the number of mashed units to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. 
(ix) determine the total acidity of the drained liquid by titration, using the following method: measure with a pipette 10 milliliters of the unfiltered drained liquid into a 250-milliliter erlenmeyer flask. add 25 milliliters of distilled or deionized water and 0.3 milliliter of 1-percent phenolphthalein solution. titrate with one-tenth normal sodium hydroxide solution to a faint, permanently pink coloration. multiply the number of milliliters of one-tenth normal sodium hydroxide required by 0.064 to calculate the number of grams of anhydrous citric acid per 100 milliliters of drained liquid to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. 
(4) if the quality of canned pineapple falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in  130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form specified in that section; however, if the quality of the canned pineapple falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of the general statement of substandard quality (good foodnot high grade) one of the following new lines, placed after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section that the canned pineapple fails to meet: 
(i) poorly cored or excessive core. 
(ii) mixed sizes or irregular small pieces, as appropriate. 
(iii) blemished or contains blemished pieces. 
(iv) excessively trimmed. 
(v) mashed units or contains mashed units. 
(vi) excessively tart. 
(vii) contains excess liquid. 
(c) fill of container. (1) the standard of fill of container for canned crushed pineapple is a fill of not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for fill of container prescribed in  130.12(b) of this chapter. 
(2) if canned crushed pineapple falls below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in  130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.
