chemicals for controlling microorganisms in cane-sugar and beet-sugar mills. 
agents for controlling microorganisms in cane-sugar and beet-sugar mills may be safely used in accordance with the following conditions: 
(a) they are used in the control of microorganisms in cane-sugar and/or beet-sugar mills as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(b) they are applied to the sugar mill grinding, crusher, and/or diffuser systems in one of the combinations listed in paragraph (b) (1), (2), (3), or (5) of this section or as a single agent listed in paragraph (b) (4) or (6) of this section. quantities of the individual additives in parts per million are expressed in terms of the weight of the raw cane or raw beets.
