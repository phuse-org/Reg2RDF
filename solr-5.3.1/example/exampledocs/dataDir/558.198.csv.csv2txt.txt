(a) specifications. type a medicated article containing 0.2 percent diclazuril. 
(b) approvals. see no. 016592 in  510.600(c) of this chapter. 
(c) related tolerances. see  556.185 of this chapter. 
(d) conditions of use (1) chickens. for chickens it is used as follows: 
diclazuril grams/ton combination grams/ton indications for use limitations sponsor (i) 0.91 (1 part per million (ppm)) broiler chickens: for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by eimeria tenella, e. necatrix, e. acervulina, e. brunetti, e. mitis mivati ), and e. maxima. because diclazuril is effective against e. maxima later in its life cycle, subclinical intestinal lesions may be present for a short time after infection. diclazuril was shown in studies to reduce lesion scores and improve performance and health of birds challenged with e. maxima. feed continuously. not for use in hens producing eggs for human food. 016592 (ii) 0.91 (1 ppm) bacitracin methylene disalicylate 4 to 50 broiler chickens: as in item (i) of this table; for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency. as in item (i) of this table. bacitracin methylene disalicylate provided by 054771. 016592 (iii) 0.91 (1 ppm) bambermycins 1 to 2 broiler chickens: as in item (i) of this table); for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency. as in item (i) of this table. bambermycins provided by 057926. 016592 (iv) 0.91 (1 ppm) virginiamycin 5 broiler chickens: as in item (i) of this table; for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency. as in item (i) of this table; virginiamycin provided by 066104. 016592 (v) 0.91 (1 ppm) virginiamycin 5 to 15 broiler chickens: as in item (i) of this table; for increased rate of weight gain. as in item (i) of this table. virginiamycin provided by 066104. 016592 
(2) turkeys. for turkeys it is used as follows: 
diclazuril grams/ton combination grams/ton indications for use limitations sponsor (i) 0.91 (1 ppm) growing turkeys: for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by e. adenoeides, e. gallopavonis and e. meleagrimitis. feed continuously as the sole ration. do not feed to breeding turkeys. not for use in hens producing eggs for human consumption. 016592 (ii) 0.91 (1 ppm). bacitracin methylene disalicylate 4 to 50. growing turkeys: as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency. as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. bacitracin methylene disalicylate provided by no. 054771 in  510.600(c) of this chapter. 016592 (iii) 0.91 (1 ppm). bambermycins 1 to 2 growing turkeys: as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; for improved feed efficiency. as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. bambermycins provided by no. 057926 in  510.600(c) of this chapter. 016592 (iv) 0.91 (1 ppm). bambermycins 2 growing turkeys: as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency. as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. bambermycins provided by no. 057926 in  510.600(c) of this chapter. 016592
