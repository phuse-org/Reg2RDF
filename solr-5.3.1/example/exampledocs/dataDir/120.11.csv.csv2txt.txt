verification and validation. 
(a) verification. each processor shall verify that the hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp) system is being implemented according to design. 
(1) verification activities shall include: 
(i) a review of any consumer complaints that have been received by the processor to determine whether such complaints relate to the performance of the haccp plan or reveal previously unidentified critical control points; 
(ii) the calibration of process monitoring instruments; 
(iii) at the option of the processor, the performance of periodic end-product or in-process testing; except that processors of citrus juice that rely in whole or in part on surface treatment of fruit shall perform end-product testing in accordance with  120.25. 
(iv) a review, including signing and dating, by an individual who has been trained in accordance with  120.13, of the records that document: 
(a) the monitoring of critical control points. the purpose of this review shall be, at a minimum, to ensure that the records are complete and to verify that the records document values that are within the critical limits. this review shall occur within 1 week (7 days) of the day that the records are made; 
(b) the taking of corrective actions. the purpose of this review shall be, at a minimum, to ensure that the records are complete and to verify that appropriate corrective actions were taken in accordance with  120.10. this review shall occur within 1 week (7 days) of the day that the records are made; and 
(c) the calibrating of any process monitoring instruments used at critical control points and the performance of any periodic end-product or in-process testing that is part of the processor's verification activities. the purpose of these reviews shall be, at a minimum, to ensure that the records are complete and that these activities occurred in accordance with the processor's written procedures. these reviews shall occur within a reasonable time after the records are made; and 
(v) the following of procedures in  120.10 whenever any verification procedure, including the review of consumer complaints, establishes the need to take a corrective action; and 
(vi) additional process verification if required by  120.25. 
(2) records that document the calibration of process monitoring instruments, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(b) of this section, and the performance of any periodic end-product and in-process testing, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(c) of this section, are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of  120.12. 
(b) validation of the haccp plan. each processor shall validate that the haccp plan is adequate to control food hazards that are reasonably likely to occur; this validation shall occur at least once within 12 months after implementation and at least annually thereafter or whenever any changes in the process occur that could affect the hazard analysis or alter the haccp plan in any way. such changes may include changes in the following: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; processing methods or systems, including computers and their software; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or the intended use or consumers of the finished product. the validation shall be performed by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with  120.13 and shall be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of  120.12. the haccp plan shall be modified immediately whenever a validation reveals that the plan is no longer adequate to fully meet the requirements of this part. 
(c) validation of the hazard analysis. whenever a juice processor has no haccp plan because a hazard analysis has revealed no food hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, the processor shall reassess the adequacy of that hazard analysis whenever there are any changes in the process that could reasonably affect whether a food hazard exists. such changes may include changes in the following: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; processing methods or systems, including computers and their software; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or the intended use or intended consumers of the finished product. the validation of the hazard analysis shall be performed by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with  120.13, and, records documenting the validation shall be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of  120.12.",
