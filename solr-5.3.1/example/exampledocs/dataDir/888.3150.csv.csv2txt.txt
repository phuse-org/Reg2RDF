elbow joint metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. an elbow joint metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace an elbow joint. it is made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, or of these alloys and of an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bushing. the device prevents dislocation in more than one anatomic plane and consists of two components that are linked together. this generic type of device is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027).
