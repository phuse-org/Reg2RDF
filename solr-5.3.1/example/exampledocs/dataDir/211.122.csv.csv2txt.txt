materials examination and usage criteria. 
(a) there shall be written procedures describing in sufficient detail the receipt, identification, storage, handling, sampling, examination, and/or testing of labeling and packaging materials; such written procedures shall be followed. labeling and packaging materials shall be representatively sampled, and examined or tested upon receipt and before use in packaging or labeling of a drug product. 
(b) any labeling or packaging materials meeting appropriate written specifications may be approved and released for use. any labeling or packaging materials that do not meet such specifications shall be rejected to prevent their use in operations for which they are unsuitable. 
(c) records shall be maintained for each shipment received of each different labeling and packaging material indicating receipt, examination or testing, and whether accepted or rejected. 
(d) labels and other labeling materials for each different drug product, strength, dosage form, or quantity of contents shall be stored separately with suitable identification. access to the storage area shall be limited to authorized personnel. 
(e) obsolete and outdated labels, labeling, and other packaging materials shall be destroyed. 
(f) use of gang-printed labeling for different drug products, or different strengths or net contents of the same drug product, is prohibited unless the labeling from gang-printed sheets is adequately differentiated by size, shape, or color. 
(g) if cut labeling is used for immediate container labels, individual unit cartons, or multiunit cartons containing immediate containers that are not packaged in individual unit cartons, packaging and labeling operations shall include one of the following special control procedures: 
(1) dedication of labeling and packaging lines to each different strength of each different drug product; 
(2) use of appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination for correct labeling during or after completion of finishing operations; or 
(3) use of visual inspection to conduct a 100-percent examination for correct labeling during or after completion of finishing operations for hand-applied labeling. such examination shall be performed by one person and independently verified by a second person. 
(4) use of any automated technique, including differentiation by labeling size and shape, that physically prevents incorrect labeling from being processed by labeling and packaging equipment. 
(h) printing devices on, or associated with, manufacturing lines used to imprint labeling upon the drug product unit label or case shall be monitored to assure that all imprinting conforms to the print specified in the batch production record.
