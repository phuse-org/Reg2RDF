(b) any otc drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted for use as a stomach acidifier is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, for which an approved new drug application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. in the absence of an approved new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act. 
(c) clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted as a stomach acidifier for otc use is safe and effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter. 
(d) after the effective date of the final regulation, any such otc drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.
