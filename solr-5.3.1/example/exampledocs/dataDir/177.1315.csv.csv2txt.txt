(c) analytical method for determination of extractability. the total extracted terephthaloyl moieties can be determined in the extracts, without evaporation of the solvent, by measuring the ultraviolet (uv) absorbance at 240 nanometers. the spectrophotometer (varian 635-d, or equivalent) is zeroed with a sample of the solvent taken from the same lot used in the extraction tests. the concentration of the total terephthaloyl moieties in water, 3 percent acetic acid, and in 8 percent aqueous alcohol is calculated as bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) by reference to standards prepared in the appropriate solvent. concentration of the terephthaloyl moieties in heptane is calculated as cyclic trimer (c co co , by reference to standards prepared in 95:5 percent (v/v) heptane: tetrahydrofuran.
