termination of requirements. 
if fda determines after approval that the requirements established in  314.520,  314.530, or  314.550 are no longer necessary for the safe and effective use of a drug product, it will so notify the applicant. ordinarily, for drug products approved under  314.510, these requirements will no longer apply when fda determines that the required postmarketing study verifies and describes the drug product's clinical benefit and the drug product would be appropriate for approval under traditional procedures. for drug products approved under  314.520, the restrictions would no longer apply when fda determines that safe use of the drug product can be assured through appropriate labeling. fda also retains the discretion to remove specific postapproval requirements upon review of a petition submitted by the sponsor in accordance with  10.30.",
