processing. 
(a) separation. within the timeframe specified in the directions for use for the blood collecting, processing, and storage system used, red blood cells may be prepared either by centrifugation, done in a manner that will not tend to increase the temperature of the blood, or by normal undisturbed sedimentation. a portion of the plasma sufficient to insure optimal cell preservation shall be left with the red cells except when a cryoprotective substance or additive solution is added for prolonged storage. 
(b) sterile system. all surfaces that come in contact with the red cells shall be sterile and pyrogen-free. 
(c) final containers. final containers used for red blood cells shall be the original blood containers unless the method of processing requires a different container. the final container shall meet the requirements for blood containers prescribed in  640.2(c). at the time of filing, if a different container is used, it shall be marked or identified by number or other symbol so as to relate it to the donor of that unit of red cells.
