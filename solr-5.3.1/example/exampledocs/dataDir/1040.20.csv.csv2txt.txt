(a) applicability. (1) the provisions of this section, as amended, are applicable as specified herein to the following products manufactured on or after september 8, 1986. 
(i) any sunlamp product. 
(ii) any ultraviolet lamp intended for use in any sunlamp product. 
(2) sunlamp products and ultraviolet lamps manufactured on or after may 7, 1980, but before september 8, 1986, are subject to the provisions of this section as published in the federal register of november 9, 1979 (44 fr 65357). 
(b) definitions. as used in this section the following definitions apply: 
(1) exposure position means any position, distance, orientation, or location relative to the radiating surfaces of the sunlamp product at which the user is intended to be exposed to ultraviolet radiation from the product, as recommended by the manufacturer. 
(2) intended means the same as intended uses in  801.4. 
(3) irradiance means the radiant power incident on a surface at a specified location and orientation relative to the radiating surface divided by the area of the surface, as the area becomes vanishingly small, expressed in units of watts per square centimeter (w/cm ). 
(4) maximum exposure time means the greatest continuous exposure time interval recommended by the manufacturer of the product. 
(5) maximum timer interval means the greatest time interval setting on the timer of a product. 
(6) protective eyewear means any device designed to be worn by users of a product to reduce exposure of the eyes to radiation emitted by the product. 
(7) spectral irradiance means the irradiance resulting from radiation within a wavelength range divided by the wavelength range as the range becomes vanishingly small, expressed in units of watts per square centimeter per nanometer (w/(cm /nm)). 
(8) spectral transmittance means the spectral irradiance transmitted through protective eyewear divided by the spectral irradiance incident on the protective eyewear. 
(9) sunlamp product means any electronic product designed to incorporate one or more ultraviolet lamps and intended for irradiation of any part of the living human body, by ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths in air between 200 and 400 nanometers, to induce skin tanning. 
(10) timer means any device incorporated into a product that terminates radiation emission after a preset time interval. 
(11) ultraviolet lamp means any lamp that produces ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength interval of 200 to 400 nanometers in air and that is intended for use in any sunlamp product. 
(c) performance requirements (1) irradiance ratio limits. for each sunlamp product and ultraviolet lamp, the ratio of the irradiance within the wavelength range of greater than 200 nanometers through 260 nanometers to the irradiance within the wavelength range of greater than 260 nanometers through 320 nanometers may not exceed 0.003 at any distance and direction from the product or lamp. 
(2) timer system. (i) each sunlamp product shall incorporate a timer system with multiple timer settings adequate for the recommended exposure time intervals for different exposure positions and expected results of the products as specified in the label required by paragraph (d) of this section. 
(ii) the maximum timer interval(s) may not exceed the manufacturer's recommended maximum exposure time(s) that is indicated on the label required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. 
(iii) no timer interval may have an error greater than 10 percent of the maximum timer interval of the product. 
(iv) the timer may not automatically reset and cause radiation emission to resume for a period greater than the unused portion of the timer cycle, when emission from the sunlamp product has been terminated. 
(v) the timer requirements do not preclude a product from allowing a user to reset the timer before the end of the preset time interval. 
(3) control for termination of radiation emission. each sunlamp product shall incorporate a control on the product to enable the person being exposed to terminate manually radiation emission from the product at any time without disconnecting the electrical plug or removing the ultraviolet lamp. 
(4) protective eyewear. (i) each sunlamp product shall be accompanied by the number of sets of protective eyewear that is equal to the maximum number of persons that the instructions provided under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section recommend to be exposed simultaneously to radiation from such product. 
(ii) the spectral transmittance to the eye of the protective eyewear required by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section shall not exceed a value of 0.001 over the wavelength range of greater than 200 nanometers 320 nanometers and a value of 0.01 over the wavelength range of greater than 320 nanometers through 400 nanometers, and shall be sufficient over the wavelength greater than 400 nanometers to enable the user to see clearly enough to reset the timer. 
(5) compatibility of lamps. an ultraviolet lamp may not be capable of insertion and operation in either the single-contact medium screw or the double-contact medium screw lampholders described in american national standard c81.10-1976, specifications for electric lamp bases and holdersscrew-shell types, which is incorporated by reference. copies are available from the american national standards institute, 1430 broadway, new york, ny 10018, or available for inspection at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. 
(d) label requirements. in addition to the labeling requirements in part 801 and the certification and identification requirements of  1010.2 and 1010.3, each sunlamp product and ultraviolet lamp shall be subject to the labeling requirements prescribed in this paragraph and paragraph (e) of this section. 
(1) labels for sunlamp products. each sunlamp product shall have a label(s) which contains: 
(i) a warning statement with the words dangerultraviolet radiation. follow instructions. avoid overexposure. as with natural sunlight, overexposure can cause eye and skin injury and allergic reactions. repeated exposure may cause premature aging of the skin and skin cancer. wear protective eyewear; failure to may result in severe burns or long-term injury to the eyes. medications or cosmetics may increase your sensitivity to the ultraviolet radiation. consult physician before using sunlamp if you are using medications or have a history of skin problems or believe yourself especially sensitive to sunlight. if you do not tan in the sun, you are unlikely to tan from the use of this product.
