use and discontinuation of a device identifier. 
(a) only one device identifier from any particular system for the issuance of unique device identifiers (udis) may be used to identify a particular version or model of a device. a particular version or model may be identified by udis from two or more systems for the issuance of udis. 
(b) a device identifier shall be used to identify only one version or model. 
(c) in the event that a version or model of a device is discontinued, its device identifier may not be reassigned to another device. if a discontinued version or model is re-introduced and no changes have been made that would require the use of a new device identifier, the device identifier that was previously in use may be used to identify the device. 
(d) in the event that an issuing agency relinquishes or does not renew its accreditation, you may continue to use a previously issued udi until such time as  830.50 requires you to assign a new device identifier.
