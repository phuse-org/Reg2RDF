orders of retention, recall, destruction, and cessation of manufacturing. 
(a) upon an agency finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an hct/p is a violative hct/p because it was manufactured in violation of the regulations in this part and, therefore, the conditions of manufacture of the hct/p do not provide adequate protections against risks of communicable disease transmission; or the hct/p is infected or contaminated so as to be a source of dangerous infection to humans; or an establishment is in violation of the regulations in this part and, therefore, does not provide adequate protections against the risks of communicable disease transmission, the food and drug administration (fda) may take one or more of the following actions: 
(1) serve upon the person who distributed the hct/p a written order that the hct/p be recalled and/or destroyed, as appropriate, and upon persons in possession of the hct/p that the hct/p must be retained until it is recalled by the distributor, destroyed, or disposed of as agreed by fda, or the safety of the hct/p is confirmed; 
(2) take possession of and/or destroy the violative hct/p; or 
(3) serve upon the establishment an order to cease manufacturing until compliance with the regulations of this part has been achieved. when fda determines there are reasonable grounds to believe there is a danger to health, such order will be effective immediately. in other situations, such order will be effective after one of the following events, whichever is later: 
(i) passage of 5 working days from the establishment's receipt of the order; or
