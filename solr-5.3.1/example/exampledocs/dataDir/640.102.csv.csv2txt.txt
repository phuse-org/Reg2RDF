manufacture of immune globulin (human). 
(a) processing method. the processing method shall be one that has been shown: (1) to be capable of concentrating tenfold from source material at least two different antibodies; (2) not to affect the integrity of the globulins; (3) to consistently yield a product which is safe for subcutaneous and intramuscular injection and (4) not to transmit viral hepatitis. 
(b) microbial contamination. low temperatures or aseptic techniques shall be used to minimize contamination by microorganisms. preservatives to inhibit growth of microorganisms shall not be used during processing. 
(c) bulk storage. the globulin fraction may be stored in bulk prior to further processing provided it is stored in clearly identified hermetically closed vessels. globulin as either a liquid concentrate or a solid and containing alcohol or more than 5 percent moisture shall be stored at a temperature of 10 c or lower. globulin as a solid free from alcohol and containing less than 5 percent moisture, shall be stored at a temperature of 0 c or lower. 
(d) determination of the lot. each lot of immune globulin (human) shall represent a pooling of approximately equal amounts of material from not less than 1,000 donors. 
(e) sterilization and heating. the final product shall be sterilized promptly after solution. at no time during processing shall the product be exposed to temperatures above 45 c, and after sterilization the product shall not be exposed to temperatures above 32 c for more than 72 hours.
