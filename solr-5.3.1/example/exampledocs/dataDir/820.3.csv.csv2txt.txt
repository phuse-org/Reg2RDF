(k) establish means define, document (in writing or electronically), and implement. 
(l) finished device means any device or accessory to any device that is suitable for use or capable of functioning, whether or not it is packaged, labeled, or sterilized. 
(m) lot or batch means one or more components or finished devices that consist of a single type, model, class, size, composition, or software version that are manufactured under essentially the same conditions and that are intended to have uniform characteristics and quality within specified limits. 
(n) management with executive responsibility means those senior employees of a manufacturer who have the authority to establish or make changes to the manufacturer's quality policy and quality system. 
(o) manufacturer means any person who designs, manufactures, fabricates, assembles, or processes a finished device. manufacturer includes but is not limited to those who perform the functions of contract sterilization, installation, relabeling, remanufacturing, repacking, or specification development, and initial distributors of foreign entities performing these functions. 
(p) manufacturing material means any material or substance used in or used to facilitate the manufacturing process, a concomitant constituent, or a byproduct constituent produced during the manufacturing process, which is present in or on the finished device as a residue or impurity not by design or intent of the manufacturer. 
(q) nonconformity means the nonfulfillment of a specified requirement. 
(r) product means components, manufacturing materials, in- process devices, finished devices, and returned devices. 
(s) quality means the totality of features and characteristics that bear on the ability of a device to satisfy fitness-for-use, including safety and performance. 
(t) quality audit means a systematic, independent examination of a manufacturer's quality system that is performed at defined intervals and at sufficient frequency to determine whether both quality system activities and the results of such activities comply with quality system procedures, that these procedures are implemented effectively, and that these procedures are suitable to achieve quality system objectives. 
(u) quality policy means the overall intentions and direction of an organization with respect to quality, as established by management with executive responsibility. 
(v) quality system means the organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes, and resources for implementing quality management.

(bb) human cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue-based product (hct/p) regulated as a device means an hct/p as defined in  1271.3(d) of this chapter that does not meet the criteria in  1271.10(a) and that is also regulated as a device. 
(cc) unique device identifier (udi) means an identifier that adequately identifies a device through its distribution and use by meeting the requirements of  830.20 of this chapter. a unique device identifier is composed of: 
(1) a device identifier a mandatory, fixed portion of a udi that identifies the specific version or model of a device and the labeler of that device; and 
(2) a production identifier a conditional, variable portion of a udi that identifies one or more of the following when included on the label of the device:
