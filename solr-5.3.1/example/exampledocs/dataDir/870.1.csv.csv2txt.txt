scope. 
(a) this part sets forth the classification of cardiovascular devices intended for human use that are in commercial distribution. 
(b) the identification of a device in a regulation in this part is not a precise description of every device that is, or will be, subject to the regulation. a manufacturer who submits a premarket notification submission for a device under part 807 may not show merely that the device is accurately described by the section title and identification provisions of a regulation in this part, but shall state why the device is substantially equivalent to other devices, as required by  807.87. 
(c) to avoid duplicative listings, a cardiovascular device that has two or more types of uses (e.g., used both as a diagnostic device and as a therapeutic device) is listed only in one subpart. 
(d) references in this part to regulatory sections of the code of federal regulations are to chapter i of title 21, unless otherwise noted. 
(e) guidance documents referenced in this part are available on the internet at http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/default.htm..
