automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) enumeration systems. 
(a) identification. an automated fish enumeration system is a device that consists of an automated scanning microscope, image analysis system, and customized software applications for fish assays. this device is intended for in vitro diagnostic use with fish assays as an aid in the detection, counting and classification of cells based on recognition of cellular color, size, and shape, and in the detection and enumeration of fish signals in interphase nuclei of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue specimens. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special control is fda's guidance document entitled class ii special controls guidance document: automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) enumeration systems. see  866.1(e) for the availability of this guidance document.
