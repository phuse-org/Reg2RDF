drugs; location of expiration date. 
when an expiration date of a drug is required, e.g., expiration dating of drug products required by  211.137 of this chapter, it shall appear on the immediate container and also the outer package, if any, unless it is easily legible through such outer package. however, when single-dose containers are packed in individual cartons, the expiration date may properly appear on the individual carton instead of the immediate product container.
