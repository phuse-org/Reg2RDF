wrist joint metal/polymer semi-constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a wrist joint metal/polymer semi-constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a wrist joint. the device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device includes prostheses that have either a one-part radial component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bearing surface, or a two-part radial component made of alloys and an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ball that is mounted on the radial component with a trunnion bearing. the metallic portion of the two-part radial component is inserted into the radius. these devices have a metacarpal component(s) made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum. this generic type of device is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class ii.",
