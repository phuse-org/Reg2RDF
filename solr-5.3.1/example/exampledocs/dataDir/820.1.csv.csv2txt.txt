scope. 
(a) applicability. (1) current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) requirements are set forth in this quality system regulation. the requirements in this part govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use. the requirements in this part are intended to ensure that finished devices will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (the act). this part establishes basic requirements applicable to manufacturers of finished medical devices. if a manufacturer engages in only some operations subject to the requirements in this part, and not in others, that manufacturer need only comply with those requirements applicable to the operations in which it is engaged. with respect to class i devices, design controls apply only to those devices listed in  820.30(a)(2). this regulation does not apply to manufacturers of components or parts of finished devices, but such manufacturers are encouraged to use appropriate provisions of this regulation as guidance. manufacturers of human blood and blood components are not subject to this part, but are subject to part 606 of this chapter. manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (hct/ps), as defined in  1271.3(d) of this chapter, that are medical devices (subject to premarket review or notification, or exempt from notification, under an application submitted under the device provisions of the act or under a biological product license application under section 351 of the public health service act) are subject to this part and are also subject to the donor-eligibility procedures set forth in part 1271 subpart c of this chapter and applicable current good tissue practice procedures in part 1271 subpart d of this chapter. in the event of a conflict between applicable regulations in part 1271 and in other parts of this chapter, the regulation specifically applicable to the device in question shall supersede the more general. 
(2) the provisions of this part shall be applicable to any finished device as defined in this part, intended for human use, that is manufactured, imported, or offered for import in any state or territory of the united states, the district of columbia, or the commonwealth of puerto rico. 
(3) in this regulation the term where appropriate is used several times. when a requirement is qualified by where appropriate, it is deemed to be appropriate unless the manufacturer can document justification otherwise. a requirement is appropriate if nonimplementation could reasonably be expected to result in the product not meeting its specified requirements or the manufacturer not being able to carry out any necessary corrective action. 
(b) the quality system regulation in this part supplements regulations in other parts of this chapter except where explicitly stated otherwise. in the event of a conflict between applicable regulations in this part and in other parts of this chapter, the regulations specifically applicable to the device in question shall supersede any other generally applicable requirements. 
(c) authority. part 820 is established and issued under authority of sections 501, 502, 510, 513, 514, 515, 518, 519, 520, 522, 701, 704, 801, 803 of the act (21 u.s.c. 351, 352, 360, 360c, 360d, 360e, 360h, 360i, 360j, 360l, 371, 374, 381, 383). the failure to comply with any applicable provision in this part renders a device adulterated under section 501(h) of the act. such a device, as well as any person responsible for the failure to comply, is subject to regulatory action. 
(d) foreign manufacturers. if a manufacturer who offers devices for import into the united states refuses to permit or allow the completion of a food and drug administration (fda) inspection of the foreign facility for the purpose of determining compliance with this part, it shall appear for purposes of section 801(a) of the act, that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, or servicing of any devices produced at such facility that are offered for import into the united states do not conform to the requirements of section 520(f) of the act and this part and that the devices manufactured at that facility are adulterated under section 501(h) of the act. 
(e) exemptions or variances. (1) any person who wishes to petition for an exemption or variance from any device quality system requirement is subject to the requirements of section 520(f)(2) of the act. petitions for an exemption or variance shall be submitted according to the procedures set forth in  10.30 of this chapter, the fda's administrative procedures. guidance is available from the food and drug administration, center for devices and radiological health, division of small manufacturers, international and consumer assistance, 10903 new hampshire ave., bldg. 66, rm. 4613, silver spring, md 20993-0002, 1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100, fax: 301-847-8149. 
(2) fda may initiate and grant a variance from any device quality system requirement when the agency determines that such variance is in the best interest of the public health. such variance will remain in effect only so long as there remains a public health need for the device and the device would not likely be made sufficiently available without the variance.
