(c) the name of the food for which a definition and standard of identity is prescribed by this section is dried egg yolks, or dried yolks, and if the glucose content was reduced, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the name shall be followed immediately by the statement glucose removed for stability or stabilized, glucose removed. 
(d)(1) when either of the optional anticaking ingredients specified in paragraph (a) of this section is used, the label shall bear the statement not more than 1 percent silicon dioxide added as an anticaking agent or less than 2 percent sodium silicoaluminate added as an anticaking agent, whichever is applicable. 
(2) the name of any optional ingredient used, as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be listed on the principal display panel or panels of the label with such prominence and conspicuousness as to render such statement likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase.
