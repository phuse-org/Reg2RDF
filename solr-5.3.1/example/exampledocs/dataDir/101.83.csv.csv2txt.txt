health claims: plant sterol/stanol esters and risk of coronary heart disease (chd). 
(a) relationship between diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters and the risk of chd. (1) cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. coronary heart disease (chd) is one of the most common and serious forms of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. high blood total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. high chd rates occur among people with high total cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) (6.21 millimole per liter (mmol/l)) or above and ldl cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dl (4.13 mmol/l) or above. borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dl (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/l) for total cholesterol, and 130 to 159 mg/dl (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/l) of ldl cholesterol. 
(2) populations with a low incidence of chd tend to have relatively low blood total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels. these populations also tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in plant foods that contain dietary fiber and other components. 
(3) scientific evidence demonstrates that diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters may reduce the risk of chd. 
(b) significance of the relationship between diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters and the risk of chd. (1) chd is a major public health concern in the united states. it accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. early management of risk factors for chd is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of chd. high blood total and ldl cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of chd. 
(2) the scientific evidence establishes that including plant sterol/stanol esters in the diet helps to lower blood total and ldl cholesterol levels. 
(c) requirements (1) general. all requirements set forth in  101.14 shall be met, except  101.14(a)(4) with respect to the disqualifying level for total fat per 50 grams (g) in dressings for salad and spreads and  101.14(e)(6) with respect to dressings for salad. 
(2) specific requirements (i) nature of the claim. a health claim associating diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that: 
(a) the claim states that plant sterol/stanol esters should be consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol; 
(b) the claim states that diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters may or might reduce the risk of heart disease; 
(c) in specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: heart disease or coronary heart disease;
