(2) the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) are applicable to ct x-ray systems manufactured or remanufactured on or after november 29, 1984. 
(b) definitions. as used in this section, the following definitions apply:

(4) ct number means the number used to represent the x-ray attenuation associated with each elemental area of the ct image. 
(5) [reserved] 
(6) ct dosimetry phantom means the phantom used for determination of the dose delivered by a ct x-ray system. the phantom shall be a right circular cylinder of polymethl-methacrylate of density 1.190.01 grams per cubic centimeter. the phantom shall be at least 14 centimeters in length and shall have diameters of 32.0 centimeters for testing any ct system designed to image any section of the body (whole body scanners) and 16.0 centimeters for any system designed to image the head (head scanners) or for any whole body scanner operated in the head scanning mode. the phantom shall provide means for the placement of a dosimeter(s) along its axis of rotation and along a line parallel to the axis of rotation 1.0 centimeter from the outer surface and within the phantom. means for the placement of a dosimeter(s) or alignment device at other locations may be provided for convenience. the means used for placement of a dosimeter(s) (i.e., hole size) and the type of dosimeter(s) used is at the discretion of the manufacturer. any effect on the doses measured due to the removal of phantom material to accommodate dosimeters shall be accounted for through appropriate corrections to the reported data or included in the statement of maximum deviation for the values obtained using the phantom.
