(5) the electronic prescription application must accept two-factor authentication that meets the requirements of  1311.115 and require its use for signing controlled substance prescriptions and for approving data that set or change logical access controls related to reviewing and signing controlled substance prescriptions. 
(6) the electronic prescription application must be capable of recording all of the applicable information required in part 1306 of this chapter for the controlled substance prescription. 
(7) if a practitioner has more than one dea registration number, the electronic prescription application must require the practitioner or his agent to select the dea registration number to be included on the prescription. 
(8) the electronic prescription application must have a time application that is within five minutes of the official national institute of standards and technology time source.

(viii) the statement required under  1311.140(a)(3). 
(10) the electronic prescription application must require the prescribing practitioner to indicate that each controlled substance prescription is ready for signing. the electronic prescription application must not permit alteration of the dea elements after the practitioner has indicated that a controlled substance prescription is ready to be signed without requiring another review and indication of readiness for signing. any controlled substance prescription not indicated as ready to be signed shall not be signed or transmitted. 
(11) while the information required by paragraph (b)(9) of this section and the statement required by  1311.140(a)(3) remain displayed, the electronic prescription application must prompt the prescribing practitioner to authenticate to the application, using two-factor authentication, as specified in  1311.140(a)(4), which will constitute the signing of the prescription by the practitioner for purposes of  1306.05(a) and (e) of this chapter. 
(12) the electronic prescription application must not permit a practitioner other than the prescribing practitioner whose dea number (or institutional practitioner dea number and extension data for the individual practitioner) is listed on the prescription as the prescribing practitioner and who has indicated that the prescription is ready to be signed to sign the prescription. 
(13) where a practitioner seeks to prescribe more than one controlled substance at one time for a particular patient, the electronic prescription application may allow the practitioner to sign multiple prescriptions for a single patient at one time using a single invocation of the two-factor authentication protocol provided the following has occurred: the practitioner has individually indicated that each controlled substance prescription is ready to be signed while the information required by paragraph (b)(9) of this section for each such prescription is displayed along with the statement required by  1311.140(a)(3). 
(14) the electronic prescription application must time and date stamp the prescription when the signing function is used. 
(15) when the practitioner uses his two-factor authentication credential as specified in  1311.140(a)(4), the electronic prescription application must digitally sign at least the information required by part 1306 of this chapter and electronically archive the digitally signed record. if the practitioner signs the prescription with his own private key, as provided in  1311.145, the electronic prescription application must electronically archive a copy of the digitally signed record, but need not apply the application's digital signature to the record. 
(16) the digital signature functionality must meet the following requirements:

(18) the electronic prescription application must not transmit a controlled substance prescription unless the signing function described in  1311.140(a)(4) has been used. 
(19) the electronic prescription application must not allow alteration of any of the information required by part 1306 of this chapter after the prescription has been digitally signed. any alteration of the information required by part 1306 of this chapter after the prescription is digitally signed must cancel the prescription. 
(20) the electronic prescription application must not allow transmission of a prescription that has been printed. 
(21) the electronic prescription application must allow printing of a prescription after transmission only if the printed prescription is clearly labeled as a copy not for dispensing. the electronic prescription application may allow printing of prescription information if clearly labeled as being for informational purposes. the electronic prescription application may transfer such prescription information to medical records. 
(22) if the transmission of an electronic prescription fails, the electronic prescription application may print the prescription. the prescription must indicate that it was originally transmitted electronically to, and provide the name of, a specific pharmacy, the date and time of transmission, and that the electronic transmission failed. 
(23) the electronic prescription application must maintain an audit trail of all actions related to the following:

(24) the electronic prescription application must record within each audit record the following information: 
(i) the date and time of the event. 
(ii) the type of event. 
(iii) the identity of the person taking the action, where applicable. 
(iv) the outcome of the event (success or failure). 
(25) the electronic prescription application must conduct internal audits and generate reports on any of the events specified in  1311.150 in a format that is readable by the practitioner. such internal audits may be automated and need not require human intervention to be conducted. 
(26) the electronic prescription application must protect the stored audit records from unauthorized deletion. the electronic prescription application shall prevent modifications to the audit records. 
(27) the electronic prescription application must do the following: 
(i) generate a log of all controlled substance prescriptions issued by a practitioner during the previous calendar month and provide the log to the practitioner no later than seven calendar days after that month. 
(ii) be capable of generating a log of all controlled substance prescriptions issued by a practitioner for a period specified by the practitioner upon request. prescription information available from which to generate the log must span at least the previous two years. 
(iii) archive all logs generated. 
(iv) ensure that all logs are easily readable or easily rendered into a format that a person can read. 
(v) ensure that all logs are sortable by patient name, drug name, and date of issuance of the prescription. 
(28) where the electronic prescription application is required by this part to archive or otherwise maintain records, it must retain such records electronically for two years from the date of the record's creation and comply with all other requirements of  1311.305.",
