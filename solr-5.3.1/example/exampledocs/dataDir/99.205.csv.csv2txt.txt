application for exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application. 
(a) in certain circumstances, described in paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer may submit an application for an exemption from the requirement to submit a supplemental application for a new use for purposes of disseminating information on that use. 
(b) the manufacturer's application for an exemption shall identify the basis for the proposed exemption and shall include materials demonstrating that it would be economically prohibitive or that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary to submit a supplemental application for the new use. 
(1) if the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be economically prohibitive to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall, at a minimum, provide: 
(i) evidence explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and 
(ii) evidence demonstrating that the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the costs of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product. such evidence shall include: 
(a) a description of the additional studies that the manufacturer believes are necessary to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, including documentation from prior discussions, if any, with the agency concerning the studies that would be needed, and an estimate of the projected costs for such studies; 
(b) the expected patient population for the new use; 
(c) the expected revenue for the new use, including an explanation of the price at which the drug or device will be sold; 
(d) any exclusivity for the drug or device for the new use; and 
(e) any other information that the manufacturer has showing that conducting the studies on the new use would be economically prohibitive; and 
(iii) an attestation by a responsible individual of the manufacturer or an individual acting on the manufacturer's behalf verifying that the estimates included with the submission are accurate and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures. the data underlying and supporting the estimates shall be made available to fda upon request. alternatively, a manufacturer may submit a report of an independent certified public accountant in accordance with the statement of standards for attestation established by the american institute of certified public accountants and agreed upon procedures performed with respect to the estimates submitted under this section. 
(2) if the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary for the supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall provide evidence: 
(i) explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the new use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and 
(ii) explaining why it would be unethical to conduct the further studies that would be necessary for the approval of the new use. such evidence shall establish that, notwithstanding the insufficiency of available data to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study (e.g., by providing no therapy, a placebo, an alternative therapy, or an alternative dose) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects. in assessing the appropriateness of conducting studies to support the new use, the manufacturer may provide evidence showing that the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy. the manufacturer shall also address the possibility of conducting studies in different populations or of modified design (e.g., adding the new therapy to existing treatments or using an alternative dose if monotherapy studies could not be conducted).",
