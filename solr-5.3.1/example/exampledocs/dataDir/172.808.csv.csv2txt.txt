copolymer condensates of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. 
copolymer condensates of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may be safely used in food under the following prescribed conditions: 
(a) the additive consists of one of the following: 
(1) -hydro- omega -hydroxy-poly (oxyethylene) poly(oxypropylene)-(55-61 moles)poly(oxyethylene) block copolymer, having a molecular weight range of 9,760-13,200 and a cloud point above 100 c in 1 percent aqueous solution. 
(2) -hydro -omega- hydroxy-poly (oxy-ethylene)poly(oxypropylene)-(53-59 moles)poly(oxyethylene)(14-16 moles) block copolymer, having a molecular weight range of 3,500-4,125 and a cloud point of 9 c-12 c in 10 percent aqueous solution. 
(3) -hydro- omega -hydroxy-poly(ox-yethylene)/poly(oxypropylene) (minimum 15 moles)/poly(oxyethylene) block copolymer, having a minimum average molecular weight of 1900 and a minimum cloud point of 9 c-12 c in 10 percent aqueous solution. 
(4) -hydro- omega -hydroxy-poly(ox-yethylene) poly (oxypropylene)-(51-57 moles) poly(oxyethylene) block copolymer, having an average molecular weight of 14,000 and a cloud point above 100 c in 1 percent aqueous solution. 
(b) the additive is used or intended for use as follows: 
(1) the additive identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is used in practice as a solubilizing and stabilizing agent in flavor concentrates (containing authorized flavoring oils) for use in foods for which standards of identity established under section 401 of the act do not preclude such use, provided that the weight of the additive does not exceed the weight of the flavoring oils in the flavor concentrate. 
(2) the additive identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is used as a processing aid and wetting agent in combination with dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate for fumaric acid as prescribed in  172.810. 
(3) the additive identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is used: 
(i) as a surfactant and defoaming agent, at levels not to exceed 0.05 percent by weight, in scald baths for poultry defeathering, followed by potable water rinse. the temperatures of the scald baths shall be not less than 125 f. 
(ii) as a foam control and rinse adjuvant in hog dehairing machines at a use level of not more than 5 grams per hog. 
(4) the additive identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is used as a dough conditioner in yeast-leavened bakery products for which standards of identity established under section 401 of the act do not preclude such use, provided that the amount of the additive dose not exceed 0.5 percent by weight of the flour used.
