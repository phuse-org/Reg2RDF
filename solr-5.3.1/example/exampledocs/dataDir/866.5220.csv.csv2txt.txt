(a) identification. a cohn fraction ii immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents that contain or are used to measure that fraction of plasma containing protein gamma globulins, predominantly of the igg class. the device may be used as a coprecipitant in radioimmunoassay methods, as raw material for the purification of igg subclasses, and to reduce nonspecific adsorption of plasma proteins in immunoassay techniques. measurement of these proteins aids in the diagnosis of any disease concerned with abnormal levels of igg gamma globulins such as agammaglobulinemia or multiple myeloma. 
(b) classification. class i (general controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in  866.9.
