(4) in the event that a registrant fails to comply with these conditions, the special agent in charge may cancel such central recordkeeping authorization, and all other central recordkeeping authorizations held by the registrant without a hearing or other procedures. in the event of a cancellation of central recordkeeping authorizations under this paragraph the registrant shall, within the time specified by the special agent in charge, comply with the requirements of this section that all records be kept at the registered location.
