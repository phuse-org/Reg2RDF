(v) a description of possible risks and side effects to be anticipated on the basis of prior experience with the drug under investigation or with related drugs, and of precautions or special monitoring to be done as part of the investigational use of the drug. 
(6) protocols. (i) a protocol for each planned study. (protocols for studies not submitted initially in the ind should be submitted in accordance with  312.30(a).) in general, protocols for phase 1 studies may be less detailed and more flexible than protocols for phase 2 and 3 studies. phase 1 protocols should be directed primarily at providing an outline of the investigationan estimate of the number of patients to be involved, a description of safety exclusions, and a description of the dosing plan including duration, dose, or method to be used in determining doseand should specify in detail only those elements of the study that are critical to safety, such as necessary monitoring of vital signs and blood chemistries. modifications of the experimental design of phase 1 studies that do not affect critical safety assessments are required to be reported to fda only in the annual report. 
(ii) in phases 2 and 3, detailed protocols describing all aspects of the study should be submitted. a protocol for a phase 2 or 3 investigation should be designed in such a way that, if the sponsor anticipates that some deviation from the study design may become necessary as the investigation progresses, alternatives or contingencies to provide for such deviation are built into the protocols at the outset. for example, a protocol for a controlled short-term study might include a plan for an early crossover of nonresponders to an alternative therapy. 
(iii) a protocol is required to contain the following, with the specific elements and detail of the protocol reflecting the above distinctions depending on the phase of study: 
) a statement of the objectives and purpose of the study. 
) the name and address and a statement of the qualifications (curriculum vitae or other statement of qualifications) of each investigator, and the name of each subinvestigator (e.g., research fellow, resident) working under the supervision of the investigator; the name and address of the research facilities to be used; and the name and address of each reviewing institutional review board. 
) the criteria for patient selection and for exclusion of patients and an estimate of the number of patients to be studied. 
) a description of the design of the study, including the kind of control group to be used, if any, and a description of methods to be used to minimize bias on the part of subjects, investigators, and analysts. 
) the method for determining the dose(s) to be administered, the planned maximum dosage, and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug. 
) a description of the observations and measurements to be made to fulfill the objectives of the study. 
) a description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other measures to be taken to monitor the effects of the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk. 
(7) chemistry, manufacturing, and control information. (i) as appropriate for the particular investigations covered by the ind, a section describing the composition, manufacture, and control of the drug substance and the drug product. although in each phase of the investigation sufficient information is required to be submitted to assure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug, the amount of information needed to make that assurance will vary with the phase of the investigation, the proposed duration of the investigation, the dosage form, and the amount of information otherwise available. fda recognizes that modifications to the method of preparation of the new drug substance and dosage form and changes in the dosage form itself are likely as the investigation progresses. therefore, the emphasis in an initial phase 1 submission should generally be placed on the identification and control of the raw materials and the new drug substance. final specifications for the drug substance and drug product are not expected until the end of the investigational process. 
(ii) it should be emphasized that the amount of information to be submitted depends upon the scope of the proposed clinical investigation. for example, although stability data are required in all phases of the ind to demonstrate that the new drug substance and drug product are within acceptable chemical and physical limits for the planned duration of the proposed clinical investigation, if very short-term tests are proposed, the supporting stability data can be correspondingly limited. 
(iii) as drug development proceeds and as the scale or production is changed from the pilot-scale production appropriate for the limited initial clinical investigations to the larger-scale production needed for expanded clinical trials, the sponsor should submit information amendments to supplement the initial information submitted on the chemistry, manufacturing, and control processes with information appropriate to the expanded scope of the investigation. 
(iv) reflecting the distinctions described in this paragraph (a)(7), and based on the phase(s) to be studied, the submission is required to contain the following: 
drug substance. a description of the drug substance, including its physical, chemical, or biological characteristics; the name and address of its manufacturer; the general method of preparation of the drug substance; the acceptable limits and analytical methods used to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug substance; and information sufficient to support stability of the drug substance during the toxicological studies and the planned clinical studies. reference to the current edition of the united states pharmacopeianational formulary may satisfy relevant requirements in this paragraph. 
drug product. a list of all components, which may include reasonable alternatives for inactive compounds, used in the manufacture of the investigational drug product, including both those components intended to appear in the drug product and those which may not appear but which are used in the manufacturing process, and, where applicable, the quantitative composition of the investigational drug product, including any reasonable variations that may be expected during the investigational stage; the name and address of the drug product manufacturer; a brief general description of the manufacturing and packaging procedure as appropriate for the product; the acceptable limits and analytical methods used to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product; and information sufficient to assure the product's stability during the planned clinical studies. reference to the current edition of the united states pharmacopeianational formulary may satisfy certain requirements in this paragraph. 
) a brief general description of the composition, manufacture, and control of any placebo used in a controlled clinical trial.
