animal care. 
(a) there shall be standard operating procedures for the housing, feeding, handling, and care of animals. 
(b) all newly received animals from outside sources shall be isolated and their health status shall be evaluated in accordance with acceptable veterinary medical practice. 
(c) at the initiation of a nonclinical laboratory study, animals shall be free of any disease or condition that might interfere with the purpose or conduct of the study. if, during the course of the study, the animals contract such a disease or condition, the diseased animals shall be isolated, if necessary. these animals may be treated for disease or signs of disease provided that such treatment does not interfere with the study. the diagnosis, authorizations of treatment, description of treatment, and each date of treatment shall be documented and shall be retained. 
(d) warm-blooded animals, excluding suckling rodents, used in laboratory procedures that require manipulations and observations over an extended period of time or in studies that require the animals to be removed from and returned to their home cages for any reason (e.g., cage cleaning, treatment, etc.), shall receive appropriate identification. all information needed to specifically identify each animal within an animal-housing unit shall appear on the outside of that unit. 
(e) animals of different species shall be housed in separate rooms when necessary. animals of the same species, but used in different studies, should not ordinarily be housed in the same room when inadvertent exposure to control or test articles or animal mixup could affect the outcome of either study. if such mixed housing is necessary, adequate differentiation by space and identification shall be made. 
(f) animal cages, racks and accessory equipment shall be cleaned and sanitized at appropriate intervals. 
(g) feed and water used for the animals shall be analyzed periodically to ensure that contaminants known to be capable of interfering with the study and reasonably expected to be present in such feed or water are not present at levels above those specified in the protocol. documentation of such analyses shall be maintained as raw data. 
(h) bedding used in animal cages or pens shall not interfere with the purpose or conduct of the study and shall be changed as often as necessary to keep the animals dry and clean. 
(i) if any pest control materials are used, the use shall be documented. cleaning and pest control materials that interfere with the study shall not be used.
