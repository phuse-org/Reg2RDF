pentaerythritol adipate-stearate. 
pentaerythritol adipate-stearate identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be safely used as a lubricant in the fabrication of rigid and semi-rigid polyvinyl chloride and/or vinyl chloride-propylene copolymers complying with  177.1980 of this chapter used as articles or components of articles that contact food, excluding food with alcohol content greater than 8 percent under conditions of use of e, f, and g described in table 2 in  175.300(d) of this chapter, subject to the provisions of this section. 
(a) identity. for the purpose of this section, pentaerythritol adipate-stearate is an ester of pentaerythritol with adipic acid and stearic acid and its associated fatty acids (chiefly palmitic), with adipic acid comprising 14 percent and stearic acid and its associated acids (chiefly palmitic) comprising 71 percent of the organic moieties.
