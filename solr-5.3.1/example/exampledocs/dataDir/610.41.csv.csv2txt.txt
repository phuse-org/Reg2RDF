donor deferral. 
(a) you, an establishment that collects human blood or blood components, must defer donors testing reactive by a screening test for evidence of infection due to a communicable disease agent(s) listed in  610.40(a) or reactive for a serological test for syphilis under  610.40(i), from future donations of human blood and blood components, except: 
(1) you are not required to defer a donor who tests reactive for anti-hbc or anti-htlv, types i or ii, on only one occasion. when a supplemental (additional, more specific) test for anti-hbc or anti-htlv, types i and ii, has been approved for use under  610.40(e) by fda, such a donor must be deferred; 
(2) a deferred donor who tests reactive for evidence of infection due to a communicable disease agent(s) listed in  610.40(a) may serve as a donor for blood or blood components shipped or used under  610.40(h)(2)(ii); 
(3) a deferred donor who showed evidence of infection due to hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) when previously tested under  610.40(a), (b), and (e) subsequently may donate source plasma for use in the preparation of hepatitis b immune globulin (human) provided the current donation tests nonreactive for hbsag and the donor is otherwise determined to be suitable; 
(4) a deferred donor, who otherwise is determined to be suitable for donation and tests reactive for anti-hbc or for evidence of infection due to htlv, types i and ii, may serve as a donor of source plasma; 
(5) a deferred donor who tests reactive for a communicable disease agent(s) described under  610.40(a) or reactive with a serological test for syphilis under  610.40(i), may serve as an autologous donor under  610.40(d). 
(b) a deferred donor subsequently may be found to be suitable as a donor of blood or blood components by a requalification method or process found acceptable for such purposes by fda. such a donor is considered no longer deferred. 
(c) you must comply with the requirements under  610.46 and 610.47 when a donor tests reactive by a screening test for hiv or hcv required under  610.40(a) and (b), or when you are aware of other reliable test results or information indicating evidence of hiv or hcv infection.
