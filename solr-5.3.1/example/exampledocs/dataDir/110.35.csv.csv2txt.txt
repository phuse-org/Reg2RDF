(b) substances used in cleaning and sanitizing; storage of toxic materials. (1) cleaning compounds and sanitizing agents used in cleaning and sanitizing procedures shall be free from undesirable microorganisms and shall be safe and adequate under the conditions of use. compliance with this requirement may be verified by any effective means including purchase of these substances under a supplier's guarantee or certification, or examination of these substances for contamination. only the following toxic materials may be used or stored in a plant where food is processed or exposed: 
(i) those required to maintain clean and sanitary conditions; 
(ii) those necessary for use in laboratory testing procedures; 
(iii) those necessary for plant and equipment maintenance and operation; and 
(iv) those necessary for use in the plant's operations. 
(2) toxic cleaning compounds, sanitizing agents, and pesticide chemicals shall be identified, held, and stored in a manner that protects against contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials. all relevant regulations promulgated by other federal, state, and local government agencies for the application, use, or holding of these products should be followed. 
(c) pest control. no pests shall be allowed in any area of a food plant. guard or guide dogs may be allowed in some areas of a plant if the presence of the dogs is unlikely to result in contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials. effective measures shall be taken to exclude pests from the processing areas and to protect against the contamination of food on the premises by pests. the use of insecticides or rodenticides is permitted only under precautions and restrictions that will protect against the contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, and food-packaging materials. 
(d) sanitation of food-contact surfaces. all food-contact surfaces, including utensils and food-contact surfaces of equipment, shall be cleaned as frequently as necessary to protect against contamination of food. 
(1) food-contact surfaces used for manufacturing or holding low-moisture food shall be in a dry, sanitary condition at the time of use. when the surfaces are wet-cleaned, they shall, when necessary, be sanitized and thoroughly dried before subsequent use. 
(2) in wet processing, when cleaning is necessary to protect against the introduction of microorganisms into food, all food-contact surfaces shall be cleaned and sanitized before use and after any interruption during which the food-contact surfaces may have become contaminated. where equipment and utensils are used in a continuous production operation, the utensils and food-contact surfaces of the equipment shall be cleaned and sanitized as necessary. 
(3) non-food-contact surfaces of equipment used in the operation of food plants should be cleaned as frequently as necessary to protect against contamination of food. 
(4) single-service articles (such as utensils intended for one-time use, paper cups, and paper towels) should be stored in appropriate containers and shall be handled, dispensed, used, and disposed of in a manner that protects against contamination of food or food-contact surfaces. 
(5) sanitizing agents shall be adequate and safe under conditions of use. any facility, procedure, or machine is acceptable for cleaning and sanitizing equipment and utensils if it is established that the facility, procedure, or machine will routinely render equipment and utensils clean and provide adequate cleaning and sanitizing treatment.
