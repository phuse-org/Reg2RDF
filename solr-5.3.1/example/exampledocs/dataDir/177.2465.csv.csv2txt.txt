polymethylmethacrylate/poly(trimethoxysilylpropyl)methacrylate copolymers. 
polymethylmethacrylate/poly(trimethoxysilylpropyl) methacrylate copolymers (cas reg. no. 26936-30-1) may be safely used as components of surface primers used in conjunction with silicone polymers intended for repeated use and complying with  175.300 of this chapter and  177.2600, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions. 
(a) identity. for the purpose of this section, polymethylmethacrylate/poly(trimethoxysilylpropyl)methacrylate copolymers are produced by the polymerization of methylmethacrylate and trimethoxysilylpropylmethacrylate. 
(b) conditions of use. (1) the polymethylmethacrylate/poly(tri-meth-oxy-silyl-propyl)methacrylate copolymers are used at levels not to exceed 6.0 percent by weight of the primer formulation. 
(2) the copolymers may be used in food contact applications with all food types under conditions of use b through h as described in table 2 of  176.170(c) of this chapter.
