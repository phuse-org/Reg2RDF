immunofluorometer equipment. 
(a) identification. immunofluorometer equipment for clinical use with its electrical power supply is a device used to measure the fluorescence of fluorochrome-labeled antigen-antibody complexes. the concentration of these complexes may be measured by means of reflected light. a beam of light is passed through a solution in which a fluorochrome has been selectively attached to serum protein antibody molecules in suspension. the amount of light emitted by the fluorochrome label is detected by a photodetector, which converts light energy into electrical energy. the amount of electrical energy registers on a readout system such as a digital voltmeter or a recording chart. this electrical readout is called the fluorescence value and is used to measure the concentration of antigen-antibody complexes. 
(b) classification. class i (general controls). the device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart e of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in  866.9.
