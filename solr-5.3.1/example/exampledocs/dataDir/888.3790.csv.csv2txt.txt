wrist joint metal constrained cemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a wrist joint metal constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a wrist joint. the device prevents dislocation in more than one anatomic plane and consists of either a single flexible across-the-joint component or two components linked together. this generic type of device is limited to a device which is made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement ( 888.3027). 
(b) classification. class iii. 
(c) date pma or notice of completion of a pdp is required. a pma or a notice of completion of a pdp is required to be filed with the food and drug administration on or before december 26, 1996 for any wrist joint metal constrained cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976, or that has, on or before december 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a wrist joint metal constrained cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before may 28, 1976. any other wrist joint metal constrained cemented prosthesis shall have an approved pma or a declared completed pdp in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
