bacterially-derived carbohydrase enzyme preparation. 
(a) bacterially-derived carbohydrase enzyme preparation is obtained from the culture filtrate resulting from a pure culture fermentation of a nonpathogenic and nontoxigenic strain of bacillus subtilis or b. amyloliquefaciens. the preparation is characterized by the presence of the enzymes -amylase (ec 3.2.1.1) and -glucanase (ec 3.2.1.6), which catalyze the hydrolysis of -glycosyl bonds in carbohydrates. 
(b) the ingredient meets the general requirements and additional requirements in the monograph on enzyme preparations in the food chemicals codex, 4th ed. (1996), pp. 128-135, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 u.s.c. 552(a) and 1 cfr part 51. copies are available from the national academy press, 2101 constitution ave. nw., washington, dc 20418, or may be examined at the center for food safety and applied nutrition's library, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740, or at the national archives and records administration (nara). for information on the availability of this material at nara, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. in addition, antibiotic activity is absent in the enzyme preparation when determined by an appropriate validated method such as the method determination of antibiotic activity in the compendium of food additive specifications, vol. 2, joint fao/who expert committee on food additives (jecfa), food and agriculture organization of the united nations, rome, 1992. copies are available from bernan associates, 4611-f assembly dr., lanham, md 20706, or from the united nations bookshop, general assembly bldg., rm. 32, new york, ny 10017, or by inquiries sent to http://www.fao.org. copies may be examined at the center for food safety and applied nutrition's library, 5100 paint branch pkwy., college park, md 20740. 
(c) in accordance with  184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice. the affirmation of this ingredient as gras as a direct food ingredient is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use: 
(1) the ingredient is used as an enzyme as defined in  170.3(o)(9) of this chapter to hydrolyze polysaccharides (e.g., starch). 
(2) the ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.
