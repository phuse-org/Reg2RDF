knee joint patellofemorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis. 
(a) identification. a knee joint patellofemorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a knee joint. the device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. it has no linkage across-the-joint. this generic type of device is designed to achieve biological fixation to bone without the use of bone cement. this identification includes fixed-bearing knee prostheses where the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene tibial bearing is rigidly secured to the metal tibial base plate. 
(b) classification. class ii (special controls). the special control is fda's guidance: class ii special controls guidance document: knee joint patellofemorotibial and femorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prostheses; guidance for industry and fda. see  888.1 for the availability of this guidance.
