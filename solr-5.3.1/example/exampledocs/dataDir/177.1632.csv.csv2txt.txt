poly(phenyl-enetereph-thala-mide) resins. 
poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resins identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be safely used as articles or components of articles intended for repeated contact with food. 
(a) identity. for the purpose of this section, the poly(phenylene- terephthalamide) resins (cas reg. no. 26125-61-1) are produced by the polymerization of terephthalolyl chloride with -phenylenediamine. the poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resin fibers and yarns may contain optional adjuvant substances required in their preparation and finishing. 
(b) optional adjuvant substances. the poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resins identified in paragraph (a) of this section may contain the following optional adjuvant substances, subject to any limitation on their use: 
(1) optional adjuvant substances authorized for this use in accordance with  174.5 of this chapter. 
(2) optional finish components, total weight not to exceed 1 percent by weight of the base polymer, as follows: 
list of substances limitations diundecylphthalate (cas reg. no. 3648-20-2). mono- and dipotassium salts of lauryl phosphate (cas reg. no. 39322-78-6). -phenylphenol (cas reg. no. 90-43-7) for use as a fungicide for finish coating materials. not to exceed 0.01 percent by weight of the base polymer. poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene)mono-butylether (cas reg. no. 9038-95-3). poly(oxyethylene) mono(nonylphenyl)ether (cas reg. no. 9016-45-9). polyvinyl methylether (cas reg. no. 9003-09-2). poly(oxyethylene) sorbitol monolaurate tetraoleate (cas reg. no. 71243-28-2). poly(oxyethylene) sorbitol hexaoleate (cas reg. no. 57171-56-9). 4,4-butylidenebis (6- tert -butyl- -cresol) (cas reg. no. 85-60-9) for use only as an oxidation inhibitor for finish coating materials. not to exceed 0.01 percent by weight of the base polymer. 
(c) specifications. (1) poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resins in the form of continuous filament yarns or fibers that have been scoured in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, when refluxed in a 50 percent ethanol/water mixture for 24 hours, yields total extractables not exceeding 0.5 percent by weight of the sample. 
(2) poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resins in the form of pulp, when refluxed in a 50 percent ethanol/water mixture for 24 hours, yields total extractables not exceeding 0.65 percent by weight of the sample. 
(d) conditions of use. (1) poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resins in the form of continuous filament yarns and fibers may be used as components of articles intended for repeated use in contact with food at temperatures not to exceed 260 c (500 f). all items are scoured prior to use by agitation in a water bath containing 0.5 gram/liter of tetrasodium pyrophosphate and 0.5 percent detergent. the items are agitated at 80 c (180 f) for 20 minutes, and then subjected to a cold water rinse. 
(2) poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) resins in the form of pulp may be used as gaskets and packing for food processing equipment at temperatures not to exceed 260 c (500 f).
