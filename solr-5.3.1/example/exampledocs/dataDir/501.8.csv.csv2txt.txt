" 501.8 
labeling of animal food with number of servings. 
(a) the label of any package of a food which bears a representation as to the number of servings contained in such package shall bear in immediate conjunction with such statement, and in the same size type as is used for such statement, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving; however, such statement may be expressed in terms that differ from the terms used in the required statement of net quantity of contents (for example, cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, etc.) when such differing term is common to cookery and describes a constant quantity. such statement may not be misleading in any particular. a statement of the number of units in a package is not in itself a statement of the number of servings. 
(b) if there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated pursuant to the procedures found in 15 cfr part 10 by the department of commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the term serving with respect to a particular food, then any label representation as to the number of servings in such packaged food shall correspond with such quantitative definition. (copies of published standards are available upon request from the national bureau of standards, department of commerce, washington, dc 20234.)",
